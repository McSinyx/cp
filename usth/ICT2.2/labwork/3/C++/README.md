# Labwork 3: Implementations in C++

At this point I've come to realized that like Thanos, C++ is inevitable.
Despite my disgust toward the language (TBH I don't like Java any better),
I need to know it enough, at least at the read-only level.

Compilation of tests could be done as follows (on Unix-like system of course,
since poor Windows users don't even have a standard C/C++ compiler):

    c++ <classname>*.cc
