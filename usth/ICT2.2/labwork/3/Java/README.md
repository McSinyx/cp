# Labwork 3: Implementations in Java

For the ease of typing, the test files are named `<classname>Test.java`
instead of `<classname>TestDrive.java`.
To rename them to the original requirement, use Perl `rename` and GNU `sed`

```sh
rename s/Test/TestDrive/ *Test.java
sed -i s/Test/TestDrive/ *TestDrive.java
```
