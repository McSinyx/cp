\section{Cocktail Shaker Sort}
The code is implemented following the cocktail shaker sort's
pseudocode\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail\_shaker\_sort\#Pseudocode}}
with bubble sort's optimization\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble\_sort\#Optimizing\_bubble\_sort}}
whose time complexity is analyzed as follows

\subsection{Best Case}
For the matter of brevity, we consider all operations on the array's $n$ members
are in constant time ($\Theta(1)$).  If the array is already sorted, after
the first \verb|while| loop (line 25), \verb|h| is still \verb|low| and thus
the \verb|do|--\verb|while| loop is broken.  Since the while loop runs from
\verb|low + size| to \verb|high - size| by \verb|size| steps, the running time
is \verb|(high - low - size*2)/size + 1| or \verb|nmemb - 1|.  Therefore
the best case time complexity is $\Omega(n - 1) = \Omega(n)$.

\subsection{Average Case}
Assume the average case is when the array is uniformly shuffled, that is,
every permutation has the equal probability to occur.

Given a permutation of an $n$-element array, consider the positive integer
$k \le n$ that exactly the last $n - k$ members are continuously in the
correct positions (as in the ascendingly sorted array).  It is obvious that
for $k = 1$, the array is sorted and the probability of the permutation
to appear is $1/n!$.  For $1 < k \le n$, if we fix the last $n - k$ members
in their right places, out of the $k!$ permutations of the first $k$ elements,
$(k - 1)!$ ones has the $k$-th greatest at the correct place.  Therefore,
let $X$ be the number that exactly $n - X$ last elements are in
the right positions, we have
\[p_X(k) = \begin{dcases}
  \frac{1}{n!} &\text{if }k = 1\\
  \frac{k! - (k - 1)!}{n!} &\text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}\]

Applying this to the first \verb|while| (line 25) with $n$ and $X - 1$ being
the number of steps from \verb|low| to \verb|high|, before and after
\verb|high = h| respectively, the expectation of $X$ is
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf E[X] &= \sum_{k=1}^n k p_X(k)\\
  &= \frac{1}{n!} + \sum_{k=2}^n\frac{k!k - k!}{n!}\\
  &= \frac{1}{n!} + \sum_{k=3}^{n+1}\frac{k!}{n!}
   - \sum_{k=2}^n\frac{k!}{n!} - \sum_{k=2}^n\frac{k!}{n!}\\
  &= \frac{1}{n!} + \frac{(n+1)!}{n!}
   - \frac{2!}{n!} - \sum_{k=2}^n\frac{k!}{n!}\\
  &= n + 1 - \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{k!}{n!}\\
  &= n - \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{k!}{n!}
\end{align*}

Hence after line 28, the newly sorted length of the array is
\[n - \mathbf E[X - 1] = n - \mathbf E[X] + 1
  = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{k!}{n!} = \Theta(1)\]

Similarly, line 31 to 35 also sort $\Theta(1)$ element(s), thus each iteration
of the \verb|do|--\verb|while| loop to sort $\Theta(1)$ members. The overall
average-case time complexity is
\begin{align*}
  T(n) &= \begin{dcases}
    (n - \Theta(1)) + (n - \Theta(1)) + T(n - \Theta(1)) &\text{if }n > 0\\
    \Theta(1) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{dcases}\\
  &= \begin{dcases}
    2n - \Theta(1) + T(n - \Theta(1)) &\text{if }n > 0\\
    \Theta(1) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{dcases}\\
  &= \Theta(1) + \sum_{k=1}^m(2k - \Theta(1))
  = 2\sum_{k=1}^m k - \sum_{k=1}^m\Theta(1)
  = m^2 + m - \sum_{k=1}^m\Theta(1)
\end{align*}
where $m$ satisfies
\begin{multline*}
  \exists\{f_k\mid k\in 1\,..\,m\} \subset \Theta(1),\,
  \sum_{k=1}^m f_k(n) = n
  \Longrightarrow \sum_{k=1}^m\Theta(1) = \Theta(n)
  \Longrightarrow m = \Theta(n)\\
  \Longrightarrow T(n) = \Theta\left(n^2\right) + \Theta(n) - \Theta(n)
  = \Theta\left(n^1\right)
\end{multline*}

\subsection{Worst Case}
If the array is reversely sorted, after each first \verb|while| (line 25),
\verb|high| is decreased by \verb|size|; and after each second
\verb|while| (line 32), \verb|low| is increased by \verb|size|.
For \verb|low + size >= high|, it takes \verb|(high-low-size)/size + 1 >> 1|
or \verb|nmemb / 2| iterations of the \verb|do|--\verb|while| loop (line 23).
The overall complexity would then be
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}(n - 2k + 1 + n - 2k)
  &= \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}(2n - 4k + 1)\\
  &= n^2 + 2\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor
  \left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right)
  + \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\\
  &= O\left(n^2\right)
\end{align*}

\section{Merge Sort}
As usual, the linked list is implemented using classic Lisp's \verb|cons|-cells.
The program is thus compiled by
\begin{verbatim}
cc construct.c Ex2.c -o Ex2
\end{verbatim}

To keep the implementation concise, memory safety as well as stack limit
was not considered.

It is trivial that the time complexity of \verb|merge| is $\Theta(n)$ with
$n$ being the total length of \verb|left| and \verb|right|.  For \verb|msort|,
the running time of the \verb|while| loop at line 27 is also $\Theta(n)$, where
n is the length of the input \verb|list|.  The overall time complexity is
\[T(n) = \begin{dcases}
  \Theta(1) &\text{if }n \le 1\\
  \Theta(n) + T\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\right)
  + T\left(\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil\right) &\text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}\]

The recurrence can be stated as
\[T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + \Theta(n)\]
\pagebreak

By the master theorem\footnote{Let $a \ge 1$ and $b > 1$ be constants,
and let $T(n)$ be defined on the nonnegative integers by the recurrence
\[T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + \Theta\left(n^{\log_b a}\right)\]
where $n/b$ is interpreted as either $\lfloor n/b\rfloor$ or $\lceil n/b\rceil$,
then \[T(n) = \Theta\left(n^{\log_b a}\lg n\right)\]},
\[T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + \Theta\left(n^{\log_2 2}\right)
= \Theta\left(n^{\log_2 2}\lg n\right) = \Theta(n\lg n)\]
