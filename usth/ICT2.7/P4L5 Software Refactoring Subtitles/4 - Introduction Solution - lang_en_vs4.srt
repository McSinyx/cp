1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,180
And the reason for this is because testing is inherently

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,080
incomplete. So let me re-size this a little bit, so that

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,340
I can make room for an illustration. And what I'm

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,170
going to show you here is just a reminder, that when we

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,380
test, we have a huge virtually infinite input domain, and

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,956
we have to derive from this input domain a few test

7
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:21,330
cases. By picking specific inputs in the domain, and of

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,260
course, corresponding outputs. And so what happens normally is that these

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,280
test cases represent the teeny tiny fraction of

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,920
the domain, and therefore testing is always incomplete.
