00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,630
There are many refactorings in Fowler's book, and what I'm

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,480
showing here is just a partial list. And we're not going to

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,930
have time to go through the complete list of refactorings,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,830
so what I'm going to do instead, I'm just going to pick a

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,870
few of those, but I'm going to explain in more depth,

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,600
and for which I'm going to provide some examples. In particular, we're

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
going to talk about the collapse

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,630
hierarchy refactoring, the consolidate conditional

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,600
expressions, the decompose conditionals, extract

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,418
method, extract class, and inline class.

11
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:29,420
And we're going to see each of those individually in the rest of the lesson.
