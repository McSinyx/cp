After the demo I would like to have a little quiz

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,430
about the extract method refactoring. And I would like to ask you

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,910
when is it appropriate to apply the extract method refactoring. Here I

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,890
have a set of possible scenarios. First one is when there is

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,730
duplicated code in two or more methods. When a class is too

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,730
large. When the names of two classes are too similar. Or when

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,840
a method is highly coupled with a class other than the one

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,370
where it is defined. So as usual, please mark all that apply.
