00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,280
So let's have a small quiz and see whether you can remember why can testing

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,250
guarantee that that a refactoring is behavior is

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,590
preserving. So why testing can only show the

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,080
absence of defects and not their presence?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,960
Is that because testing and refactoring are different

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,980
activities? Because testing is inherently incomplete? Or, just

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,560
because testers are often inexperienced? Make your choice.
