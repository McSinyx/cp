00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,620
So now, I would like for you to tell me

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,810
which of the following can be considered bad smells in

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,320
the context of refactoring. The fact that the program takes

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,070
too long to execute? The fact that method M in class

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,460
C is very long? Or the, the fact that Class

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,120
Cat and Dog are subclasses of class Animal? Or finally the

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,960
fact that every time we modify method M1 we also

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,120
need to modify method M2? So please mark all that apply.
