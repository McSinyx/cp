00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,220
In the previous lesson, we discussed agile

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,689
software development. Its principles and practices. And two

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,060
specific agile processes. XP and Scrub. In

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,230
this lesson, we will introduce a practice that

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,020
is of fundamental importance in the context

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,120
of agile software development. Software refactoring. Software refactoring

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,030
is the process of taking a program and

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,040
transforming it to make it better. That is,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,240
to make it easier to understand, make it

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
more maintainable, and in general to improve its

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,300
design. Specifically, we will discuss what the refactoring

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,680
is and why it is important? When to perform

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,980
refactoring, and when not to perform refactoring? And

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,520
how to perform refactoring in a fully automated way,

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,293
using tools. We will also introduce the concept

16
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:50,040
of bad smells, where a bad smell, in software,

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,323
is the indication that there might be something wrong with

18
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:56,890
the code that might call for the application of refactoring.
