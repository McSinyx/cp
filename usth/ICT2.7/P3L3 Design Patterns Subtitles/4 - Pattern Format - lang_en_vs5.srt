00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,711
So let's start by seeing how patterns are defined. So

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,620
what is the format of the pattern definitions. If we look

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,000
at the Gang of Four's book we can see that these

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,630
definitions contain a lot of information. In fact, what I'm listing

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,980
here is just a subset of this information. In this lesson,

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,510
what I want to do is to focus on four essential

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,480
elements of a design pattern. It's name, the intent which is

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,270
the goal of the pattern. The pattern's applicability which is the

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,040
list of situations or context in which the

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,560
pattern is applicable. I also want to cover the structure

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,700
and participants. Which is the static model that describes

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,870
the elements, so normally the classes or the object

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,900
involved in the pattern. In addition to that

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,400
the structure also describes

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,420
the relationships, responsibilities and collaborations

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,264
among these classes or objects. Finally what I want

17
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:50,560
to cover is sample code. So examples that illustrate

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,490
the use of patterns.
