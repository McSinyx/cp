00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,560
In the last lesson, we talked about design, and we saw how difficult it can

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,010
be to come up with a good and effective design for a given software system. To

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,620
help address these difficulties, we will discuss

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,560
design patterns, which can support design activities by

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,710
providing general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring design

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,410
problems. Similar to architectural styles, design patterns can

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,400
help developers build better designed systems by reusing design solutions that

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,730
worked well in the past and by building on those solutions.
