00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,780
Now that we've discussed how to choose a pattern. Imagine that

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,210
you have to write a class that can have only one

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,090
instance. So to satisfy this requirement, I would like for you

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,720
to pick one of the design patterns that we discussed in

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,580
this lesson, and write the code here that satisfies that requirement.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,270
And when you write the code, please make sure that your

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,140
class has only one method, without counting possible constructors, and that

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,120
the class is called Singleton. And write your class right here.
