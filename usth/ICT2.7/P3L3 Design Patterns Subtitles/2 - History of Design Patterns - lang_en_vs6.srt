1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,780
Let's start our decision of design patterns by looking

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,280
at the history of patterns. As you know, I like

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,810
to give this sort of historical perspective on how and

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,600
when concepts were defined. In this case, we have to

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,830
go back to 1977, when Christopher Alexander, an American professor

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,300
of architecture at UC Berkeley, introduces the idea of patterns,

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,700
successful solutions to problems, in his book called a Pattern

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,640
Language. The book contains about 250 patterns. And the idea

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,700
is that occupants of a building should be able

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,110
to design it. And the patterns in the book provide

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,368
a way to do that. And this idea of design

12
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,964
patterns, so, a formal way of documenting successful solutions to

13
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:41,200
problems, inspired several other disciplines. In particular, in 1987,

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,810
Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck leveraged this idea of Alexander's

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,360
patterns in the context of an object oriented language.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,840
And in this specific the language was Smalltalk.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,666
Some of you might know the language. So what Cunningham

18
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,320
and Beck did, was to create a 5 pattern

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,880
language for guiding novice Smalltalk programmers. So they did

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,090
an experiment and had several developers using their patterns, and

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,330
the experiment was extremely successful. The users were able to

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,940
create elegant designs using the provided patterns. And in case

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,210
you are interested in reading about it, Cunningham and Beck

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,660
reported the results in the article, Using Pattern Languages for

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,940
Object Oriented Programs, which was published at the

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,854
International Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and

27
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:25,390
Applications, also called OOPSLA, in 1987. At the

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,480
same time, Eric Gamma was working on his dissertation,

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,030
whose topic was the importance of patterns and

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,430
how to capture them. Between 1987 and 1992, there

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,520
were several workshops related to design patterns. And

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,740
in 1992, Jim Coplien compiled a catalog of C++

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,140
items, which are some sort of patterns, and

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,130
he listed this catalog of patterns in his

35
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,720
book, which was titled Advanced C++ Programming Styles

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,952
and Idioms. Finally, in 1993 and 1994, there were

37
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:56,160
several additional workshops focused on patterns. And this

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,625
workshop brought together many patterns folks, including these

39
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,040
4 guys, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
and John Vlissides. These guys are also known as

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,970
the gang of 4. And the result of this collaboration was the

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,840
famous book Design Patterns: Elements of

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,320
Reusable Object Oriented Software. So this

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,640
is basically The Book on design patterns. If you want to buy

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,780
a book on design pattern, this is the one you should get.
