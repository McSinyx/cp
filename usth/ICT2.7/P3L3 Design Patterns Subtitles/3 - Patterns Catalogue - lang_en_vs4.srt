00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,380
This book contains a patterns catalog which is

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,725
a number of design patterns classified by purpose. And

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:09,122
there are five main classes of patterns. There are

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:11,890
fundamental patterns which are the basic patterns. There are

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,170
creational patterns which are the patterns that support object

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,290
creation. Then there are structural patterns and these are

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,090
patterns that help compose objects, put objects together. The

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,280
next class of patterns are behavioral patterns and these

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,840
are patterns that are mostly focused on realizing interactions

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,820
among different objects. Finally, there are concurrency patterns and these

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,400
are patterns that support, as the name says, concurrency, so

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,700
they're more related to concurrency aspects. And for each of

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,560
these classes there are a number of specific patterns, and

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,130
here I'm just listing some of them. Clearly we cannot

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,740
cover in one lesson all of these patterns, but what

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,440
I want to do is to cover at least a few

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,670
of those to give an idea of what patterns are and

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,430
how they can be used. In particular, we will see in

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,200
detail the Factory Method Pattern and the Strategy Pattern. And we

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,590
will also discuss a few more patterns at a higher level.
