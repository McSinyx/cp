00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,210
To conclude this lesson, I want to discuss the

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,170
concept of negative design patterns, that is, patterns that should

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,600
be avoided. Interestingly, negative patterns were also mentioned in

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,950
Christopher Alexander's book, so in the first formulation of patterns.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,219
So negative design pattern are basically guidelines on how

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,689
not to do things. In consoles with patterns, the guidelines

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,920
on how to do things. So basically, what the negative

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,170
design patterns do is, they enable recurring design defects to

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,070
be avoided. And as we will see in this class extensively,

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,080
in mini-course four, negative patterns are

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,380
also called anti-patterns or bad smells,

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,540
or bad code smells. So in mini-course four we will see several

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,480
examples of bad smells and what we can do to eliminate them.
