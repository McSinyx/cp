00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,890
Now let's see how object oriented analysis might work

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,640
in practice by considering the following requirement for an online

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,230
shopping website. The requirement says that users can add

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,890
more than one item on sale at a time to

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,590
a shopping cart. So, looking at this requirement I

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,180
would like you to tell me which of the following

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,285
elements should be modeled as classes. And the elements

8
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:25,650
are: item, sale, shopping cart, time and user. So mark

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,370
all that apply.
