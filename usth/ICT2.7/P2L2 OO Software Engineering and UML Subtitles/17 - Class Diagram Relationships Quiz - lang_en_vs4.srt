00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,840
Before doing that, though, now that we discuss the different kinds

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,510
of relationships among classes in the class diagram. I would like

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,230
to ask you to look at a list of relationships that

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,920
I'm providing here and mark the relationships that you think actually

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,120
hold for the classes in the system that we are modeling.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,260
So here I have a list of possible relationships for each

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,070
relationship. I'm first defining what the relationship is and then what

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,270
kind of relationship that is, for example, for the first one I'm

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,500
saying that the registration manager uses

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,090
the scheduling algorithm, which is a dependency

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,860
relationship. And similarly for the other ones. So like for you to go back

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,070
to the example, look at the classes that we defined, think about the

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,360
requirements, and identify which ones of this

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,610
relationships you think hold in the system.
