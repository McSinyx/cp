00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,430
The very last diagram that I want to discuss is

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,900
the state transition diagram. The state transition diagram is defined for

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,270
each relevant class in the system and basically shows the

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,880
possible live history of a given class or object. So what

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,090
does it mean to describe the life history? It means

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,630
that it describes the possible states of the class as defined

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,910
by the values of the class attributes. And it also describes

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,710
the events that cause a transition from one state to another.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,800
Finally, it describes the actions that result from a state

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,050
change. So if you put all of this together you

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,760
can see how this can represent the whole history of

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,860
the class, from its creation to its destruction. So let me

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,610
discuss the transition diagram in more detail, and also provide

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,550
information about the notation used to represent them. We have

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,770
states, that are represented by ovals with a name. And

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,820
we have transitions marked by the event that triggers the transition.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,500
What transitions indicate is the passage from one state to

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,430
another state as the consequence of some external stimuli. Notice

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,930
that not all events will cause a state transition. So

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,930
for example, some events might be consumed within a single state.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,500
And we'll get to that in a second. But in

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,200
most cases, an event will trigger some state transition. Events

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,480
may also produce actions and they may also have attributes

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,100
which are analogous to parameters in a method call. And Boolean

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,830
conditions that guard the state transition that is prevented

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,860
from happening in the case the conditions are not

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,630
satisfied. States may also be associated with activities and

28
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,450
actions. Specifically, activities are operations performed by an object

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,410
when it is in a given state and that

30
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,690
takes time to complete. Actions, conversely, just like the

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,270
actions corresponding to an event are instantaneous operations that

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,420
are performed by an object. And can be triggered

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,050
on entry. So, when the object reaches a given state,

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,970
when the object exits that state, and also when a

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,240
specific event occurs. And in this case, this notation is

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,930
basically a shortcut for any event that will cause a

37
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,840
state transition that will bring the object back into the

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,696
same state. Since we have several actions and activities, it

39
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:04,480
is probably worthwhile clarifyinig the ordering of such actions and

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,559
activities. So the way in which these actions and activities

41
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,079
occur is, first of all, we have the actions on the

42
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,737
incoming transition, so this is performed first. Then if there is an

43
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:17,321
entry action that is the next action that would be performed, then

44
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:22,370
we have activity and event actions as appropriate. And finally exit actions.
