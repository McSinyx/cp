00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,980
The last UML structural diagram I want to discuss

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,750
is the deployment diagram. The deployment diagram provides a static

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,220
deployment view of a system, and unlike previous diagram,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,980
it is about the physical allocation of components to computational

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,950
units. Think, for example, of a client-server system in

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,130
which you'll have to define which components will go on

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,880
the server and which component will go on the

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,200
client. For deployment diagram, the nodes correspond to computation unit;

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,090
for example, a specific device. And the edges indicate communication

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,880
between these units. Also in this case, I'm going to illustrate deployment

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,720
diagrams using an example for our course management system. And

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,820
also in this case, I'm going to use a slightly more complex

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,910
diagram than usual. But I don't want you to look

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,170
at all the individual details. Instead, I would like to focus

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,530
on a few main aspects. So, if you look at

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,700
this diagram, there are three things that you should clearly see.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,555
First, you should see how the system involves four

18
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,590
nodes, a web server, an application server, a DB

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,740
server, and a mainframe. Second, you should see which

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,500
components are deployed on which nodes. For example, the student

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,400
component is deployed on the application server. And finally,

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,570
you should see how the nodes communicate with one

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,880
another. For example, you can see that the application

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,030
server and the university database communicate using a JDBC protocol.
