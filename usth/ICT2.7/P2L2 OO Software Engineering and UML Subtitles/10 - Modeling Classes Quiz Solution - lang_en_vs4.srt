1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,110
Looking at the requirements, item is definitely a relevant element

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,060
for my system, so it is appropriate to model item as

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,300
a class. Sale, on the other hand, is more of

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,610
a characteristic of an item, an attribute of an item, rather

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,960
than a class in itself. So, we're not going to mark

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,460
this one. Shopping cart sounds, as well, as an important element

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,550
for my system. Time can be an important system in some

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,420
contexts, but in this case we're measuring time just because more

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,430
than one item at a time can be added to the shopping cart.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,770
So, time really doesn't have any reason for being modeled as a class.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,550
And finally, user also seems to also have an important role to play

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,260
in the system, and therefore we will model user as a class as well.
