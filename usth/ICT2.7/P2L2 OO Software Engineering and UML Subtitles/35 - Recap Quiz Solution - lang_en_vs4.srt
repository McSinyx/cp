00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:03,320
A UML state transition diagram does not specify a set

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,960
of object that work together to perform some action, because

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,270
this is what a sequence diagram does instead. Conversely, the

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,530
second one is correct. As we said, a state transition diagram

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,790
describes the events that cause a transition from one state

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,300
to another. Again, a UML state transition diagram does not

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,270
specify the set of components in a system, because this

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,700
is what a component diagram does, not a state transition diagram.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,620
As for the last one, this is correct,

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,510
because, as we also discussed, a state transition diagram

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,000
describes the actions that result from a state

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,890
change, that is, the effects of such state change.
