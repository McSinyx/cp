1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,420
The third type of relationship that we saw, is

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,060
Generalization. Generalization is a relationship, between a general class,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,150
which we normally call super-class and the more specific

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,510
class, a class the refines the super-class and that

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,950
we normally call sub-class. It's also known as a

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,690
kind of or is a relationship because we can

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,850
say that the subclass is a super class and

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,450
it's expressed with a solid line with a big arrow

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,580
head at the end. So let's see an example of

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,160
that. In this case I'm going to indicate. Two of this kind

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,950
of relationships. The first one involving the RegistrationUser and

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,000
a student. And the second one, a RegistrationUser and the

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,960
professor. So, basically what we're showing here is a

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,170
typical case in which the registration user is a more general

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,630
concept then the Student and the Professor. So both the student

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,710
and the professor are RegistrationUsers. So there is a relationship,

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,360
the Professor is a registration user and the Student is a RegistrationUser.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,780
And therefore we can indicate that using

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,040
the generalization relationship in our class diagram.
