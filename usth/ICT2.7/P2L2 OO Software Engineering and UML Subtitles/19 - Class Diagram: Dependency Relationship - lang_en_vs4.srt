00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,040
So let's start with the dependency example. A dependency,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,720
as we said, expresses the relationship between a supplier

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,290
and a client that relies on it. There is

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,490
a dependency because changes in the supplier can affect the

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,770
client. Here in this example I am showing that

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,510
a dependency example involving the registration manager and the

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,590
scheduling algorithm. As you can see the, the dependency

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,710
is indicated with a dashed line pointing from the client

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,520
to the supplier. And here it's pretty clear why

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,820
the RegistrationManager is dependent on the Scheduling Algorithm. It's

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,710
because the RegistrationManager uses this Scheduling Algorithm. And therefore,

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,130
if the Scheduling Algorithm changes, the RegistrationManager might be

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,210
affected by that change. Another less obvious example is

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,600
the dependency between the Registration Manager and the Student.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,040
In this case, because the Registration Manager gets a

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,620
Student object as a parameter here there is a dependency

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,740
between the two. Again, if the Student class were to change the Registration

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,270
Manager might be affected because it's relying on the Student for it's behavior.
