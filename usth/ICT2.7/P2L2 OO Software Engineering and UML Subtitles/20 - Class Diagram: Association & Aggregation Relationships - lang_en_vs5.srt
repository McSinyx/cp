1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,469
The next example of relationship we're going to look at is

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,740
the association relationship. This is a relationship in which objects of

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,570
one class are connected to objects of another. And it's

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,480
called an has a relationship. So it means that objects of

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,930
one class have objects of another class. So let's see

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,750
what that means. Let's do it by considering two classes in

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,370
our example system. The student class and the course offering class.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,300
In this case, there is an association between the student and

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,010
the course offering, because the student is registering for the

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,750
course offering. So, in a sense, the course offering has students.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,360
Contains students, to indicate this fact we add a solid

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,750
line between the student class and the course offering. And the

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,540
fact that having a solid line doesn't really tell us

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,780
much about the nature of the relationship, so to clarify such

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,550
nature we can use what we call adornments that we

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,010
can apply to associations we can add to associations to clarify

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,850
their meaning. In particular we can add a label to

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,550
an association and the label describes the nature of the relationship.

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,440
In this case, for example, it clarifies that the student

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,970
registers for CourseOffering. We can also add a triangle to

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,050
further clarify the direction of the relationship. So in this

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,240
case, the triangle will indicate that it's the student That registers

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,120
for the course offering, and not the other way around. Another

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,650
important adornment or limitation that we can put on an association,

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,800
is multiplicity. Multiplicity defines the number of instances of one

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,540
class that are related to one instance of the other

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,900
class. We can define multiplicity at either end of the

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,620
relationship. In this case, for instance, we can say that

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,890
if we look at the student, the student can register

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,410
for two or more course offerings. Whereas, if we look

31
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,560
at the course offering, we can say that each course

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,260
offering can have or can enroll between 1 and 50 students.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,120
So as you can see by adding a label, a direction,

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,590
and multiplicity, we make it much clearer what the relationship is

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,170
and what it means and what are its characteristics. As we

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,130
saw when we introduced relationships, there is a different kind of

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,860
association, kind of a specialized one, which we call aggregation. So

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,130
here we're going to look at an example of an aggregation. So

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,490
first of all what is an aggregation? An aggregation is a

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,580
relationship between 2 classes in which 1 represents a larger class

41
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,610
like a whole which consists of smaller classes which are

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,430
the parts of this whole. So lets look at an example

43
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,960
in the context of our system. Let's consider a Course

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,160
and the CourseOffering. And in this case, we can see

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,000
that the Course consists of multiple CourseOfferings. So in

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,520
a sense, a course is a whole and the course offerings

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,430
are the parts of this whole. So this a perfect case

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,620
in which we will use an aggregation to express this relationship.

49
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,630
So we will add a solid line with a diamond on the side of the whole class

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,380
to indicate that the course consists of multiple course offerings.

51
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,670
And as we did for associations even though we

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,010
are not going to do it for this specific

53
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,540
example, we could also in this case add multiplicity

54
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,830
information on the aggregation to indicate how many classes

55
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,310
of the two types are involved in the relationships.
