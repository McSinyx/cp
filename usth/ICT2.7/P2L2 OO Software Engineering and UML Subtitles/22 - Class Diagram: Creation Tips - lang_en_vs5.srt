The last thing that I want to mention about class diagrams is

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,830
some creation tips. So something I know based on my experience and the

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,300
experience of others, I can recommend to do when creating a class

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,780
diagram. So the first tip is to understand the problem. So take the

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,070
time to look at the description of the system that you have

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,500
to build, to make sure that you understand the domain. That you understand

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,230
what you are supposed to build. Because that is going to save you

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,550
time later. It's going to help you identify from the beginning, a more relevant

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,370
set of entities in the description of the system. This

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,730
one might seem trivial but is very important to choose

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,910
good class names. Why? Because class names communicate the intent

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,770
of the class, and clarify what the class refers to. So

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,510
having a good class name allows you, makes it easier, to

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,390
create the mapping between the real-world object and the entities in

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,610
your model. And of course, it also makes it easier

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,100
to understand the system, after the system is built. Third tip,

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,480
concentrate on the what. So here, in the class diagram,

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,390
we're just representing the structure of the system. We're representing

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,150
what is in the system. What are the entities? What

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,140
are the characteristics of the entities? We are not focusing

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,850
at all, on how things are done. So, be careful.

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,430
DonÃ¢ÂÂt think about the how, just think about the what.

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,150
Proceed in an itinerary way. So, start with a simple

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,910
diagram and refine it. There is no need to identify,

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,650
right away, all of the details of the system you need to

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,570
build. It is much easier to look at the description, identify an initial

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,670
rough class diagram and then refine it, because in this way, you'll

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,650
also gather more understanding of the system as you build it, and you'll

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,670
most likely end up with a better product at the end. And

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,360
if you proceed in this way, then make sure to refine until you

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,920
feel the class diagram is complete, until you feel that you represent

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,960
the system that you're supposed to build. So your final goal should be

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,820
to have a class diagram that is complete.

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,870
So it represents all of the relevant entities

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,870
in the system and their characteristics, and it's

36
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,170
correct so it represents them in the right way
