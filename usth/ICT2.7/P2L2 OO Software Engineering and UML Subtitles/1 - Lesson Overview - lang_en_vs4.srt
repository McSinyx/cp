Hi. In the last lesson we discussed

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,370
requirements engineering. This lesson is about object orientation

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,958
and other related concepts. The lesson is split

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,720
in two main parts. In the first part,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,870
we will provide a quick introduction to

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,890
object orientation and object oriented analysis and design.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,750
In the second part, we will cover the

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,710
essential of UML, which is the notation that

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,190
we will use in the rest of the course and also in our projects.
