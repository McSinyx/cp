00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,130
So, I'm going to start by marking the

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,920
relationships that actually hold in the system.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,860
Which are these ones. And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to explain this

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,480
answers. Not here but in the next part of this lesson. By looking at the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,860
different relationships in the context of our

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,240
example. Which will make the explanation much clearer.
