1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,110
So in more general terms, why do we want to

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,330
use object orientation? The first reason is that object

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,530
orientation can help reduce long-term maintenance costs by limiting

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,700
the effects of changes. As we saw, the effect

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,990
of using encapsulation and information hiding makes it easier

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,700
to modify parts of the system without affecting the

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,590
rest of the system. Object orientation can also improve

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,870
the developing process by favoring code and design reuse.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,840
In general, object orientation helps

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,750
enforcing good design principles. Principles such

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,880
as the ones that we saw in encapuslation, information hiding, high

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,470
cohesion, low coupling and we will discuss these aspects more extensively

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,750
in the next mini course which is centered around design concepts.
