00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,600
Now let's make sure that we understand the benefits of

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,270
object orientation through a quiz. Imagine that acme corporation decided

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,180
to use an objetory entered approach in its software development

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,230
process. If this is the case what benefits can they expect

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,640
to receive from this decision. And here I'm listing some

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,120
possible benefits. Increased reuse because of the modular cooling style.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,450
Increased maintainability because the system design can accommodate changes more

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,530
easily. Increased speed because object oriented systems tend to run faster.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,770
And increased understandability because the

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,680
design models real world entities. So,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,310
I would like, as usual, for you to mark all that apply.
