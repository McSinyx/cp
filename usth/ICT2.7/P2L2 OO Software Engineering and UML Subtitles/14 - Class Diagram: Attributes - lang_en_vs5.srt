00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,435
Now that we identify the classes in my system,

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:04,930
let's see how we can identify the attributes for

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,680
these classes. First of all let's recall what attributes

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,355
are. Attributes represent the structure of a class the individual

5
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,530
data items that compose the state of the class.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,530
So how do we identify these attributes? Attributes may be

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,070
found in one of three ways. By examining class

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,330
definitions, by studying the requirements, and by applying domain knowledge.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,400
And notice that I want to stress, that this is always

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
a very important aspect. No matter what kind of system you're

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,670
developing. Domain knowledge tends to be fairly important to identify things

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,200
Which might not be provided in the descriptions of the system

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,070
that tend to be incomplete. And that you can derive by

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,390
the fact that you are familiar with the domain. So always

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,340
keep in mind the domain knowledge is important for analysis, for

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,430
design, for requirements gathering and so on. So now let's go

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,530
back to our description of the system. As I said,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,450
I will bring you back for each step of our

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,200
analysis. And in this case, we're going to focus on

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,550
course offering. And we can say that the course offering, according

21
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,610
to the description, has a number, a location, and a

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,140
time. So this is a pretty clear indication that these are

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,650
important aspects of the course offering. So they probably should

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,600
become attributes of the course offering class. So now if we

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,400
report here that sentence, and once more, we underline

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,330
the information that we underlined in the description. We can

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,540
clearly see how this can be mapped into the definition

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,730
of the class. So our class course offering after this

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,900
step the analysis will have 3 attributes: number, location, and

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,270
time. And as you can see here, I'm not specifying

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,540
the type or any other additional information. So in this

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,640
first step I'm just interested in having a first draft.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,170
of the class diagram, that I can then

34
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,440
refine in the next iterations of my analysis.
