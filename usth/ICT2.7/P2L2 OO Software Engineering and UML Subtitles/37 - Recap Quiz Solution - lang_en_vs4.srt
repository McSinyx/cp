1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,580
And in this case, the correct answer is that class

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,870
diagram and deployment diagrams are the only two UML structural

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,950
diagrams among these four. So the answer to this quiz

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,250
was probably pretty obvious, but I wanted to use it

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,840
also to stress, once more, the difference between structural and

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,560
behavioral diagrams. Structural diagrams provide the static picture of the

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,100
system being modeled, presented from different perspective. For example, from

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,630
the perspective of the class diagram and of the deployment diagram.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,760
Behavioral diagrams, on the other hand, provide information on

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
the dynamic behavior of the system being modeled, also

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,020
presented from different perspective. So it's important to be

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,020
able to distinguish between these two types of diagrams. This

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,450
concludes this lesson on object orientation and UML. But

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,960
I encourage you to look at the references provided

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,390
in the class notes, in case you want to

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,440
know more about object orientation, object oriented analysis, and UML.
