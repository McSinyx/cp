1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,120
Now if you want to build a use case diagram for

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,520
our example, we have to add the use cases for

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,710
these different actors. For instance, if we consider the student

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,810
and the registrar, they might be both interacting with the maintain

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,950
schedule system, the registrar by updating the schedule and the

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,125
students by using the schedule that has been updated by the

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,860
registrar. As you can see, different roles for the same

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,962
use case. Another possible use case is the request course roster.

9
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:28,520
And on this case, the professor will request the roster

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,960
by interacting with the system. We will continue in this way

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,270
by further refining and by further adding use cases as we

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,240
identify possible interactions of the actors that we identified with our

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,380
system. So in summary, what the use case diagram is doing

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,370
is to show the actors and their interaction with the system

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,680
through a set of use cases. At this point, it should

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,990
be pretty clear that sure, this gives us an idea of

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,630
the interactions but we don't really know how these interactions occur.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,870
So there is one piece that is missing, which is how

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,850
do we document the use cases, how do we describe what

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,010
happens and what these interactions actually are. And that's exactly what

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,410
we're going to discuss now, how to document use cases. So the

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,000
behavior of a use case can be specified by describing its

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,650
flow of events. And it is important to note that the

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,190
flow of events should be described from an actor's point of view,

25
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,690
so from the point of view of the external entity that

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,070
is interacting with my system. So the description should detail what

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,480
the system must provide to the actor when the use case

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,170
is executed. In particular, it should describe how the use case

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,670
starts and ends. It should describe the normal flow of events,

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,280
what is the normal interaction. And in addition to the normal

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,720
flow of events, it should also describe possibly alternative flows of

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,240
events. For example, in the case in which there are multiple

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,450
ways of accomplishing one action or performing a task. And finally,

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,880
it should also describe exceptional flow of events. For example, assume that

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,910
you are describing a use case for withdrawing money from an

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,230
ATM. You may want to describe the normal flow of events in which

37
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,590
I insert my card, I provide my pin and so on.

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,750
An alternative one in which, in addition to withdrawing cash, maybe I'll

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,550
also first ask for some information about how much money is

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,390
in my account. And finally, I may want to also describe an exceptional

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,900
flow of events in which I get my pin wrong and,

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,140
therefore, I'm not able to perform the operation. One more thing I

43
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,140
want to mention, when we talk about documenting use cases, is

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,770
the fact that the description of this information can be provided in

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,650
two main ways, in an informal way or in a formal

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,330
way. In the case of an informal description, we could just have

47
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,540
a textual description of the flow of events in natural language.

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,250
In the case of a formal or structured description, we may use,

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,610
for example, pre and post conditions, pseudo

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,680
code to indicate the steps. We could

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,010
also use the sequence diagrams, which is something that we will see in a minute.
