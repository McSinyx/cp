I'd like to conclude this lesson with a couple of

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,350
quizzes. Just to recap what we saw. And, make sure that

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,000
everybody's on the same page. In the first quiz, I want to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,930
know whether an UML state transition diagram specifies a set of

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,320
objects that work together to perform some action. The events that

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,870
cause an object to move from one state to another. The

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,840
set of components in a system, or the effects of a

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,270
state change. And as usual, you should mark all that apply.
