1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,400
Now that we have seen use cases, the next behavioral

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,540
diagram I want to discuss is the sequence diagram. So

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,070
what is a sequence diagram? It is an interaction diagram

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,710
that emphasizes how objects communicate and the time ordering of

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,940
the messages between objects. To illustrate sequence diagrams in a

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,600
practical way, and hopefully in a clear way, I will

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,960
introduce them by creating an actual sequence diagram using an

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,160
example taken from our course management system. So let's see what

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,050
are the steps needed to build such a sequence diagram. The first

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,900
thing we want to do is place the objects that participate in

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,460
the interaction at the top of the diagram along the x-axis, and

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,410
you also want to place them in a specific way. You want

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,770
to place objects that initiate the interaction at the left, and place

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,260
increasingly more subordinate objects to the

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,430
right. So basically, this should reflect

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,660
the way the events will flow for the majority of the interactions

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,202
in the system. Next thing you want to do is to add

18
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:53,910
what is called the object lifeline. It's a vertical line that

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,300
shows the existence of objects over a period of time. And

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,660
it's normally represented with a dashed line, except for the outermost

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,190
object for which it is a solid line. Now that you

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,450
have your object lifeline you can start placing messages that these

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,285
objects send and receive. You want to put them along the

24
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,860
y-axis in order of increasing time, from top to bottom. And

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,550
you can also put a number on the message to further

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,230
clarify the sequence. So in this case what we're showing

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,550
is that the student will send the fill in info

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,330
message to the registration form. And this is the first

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,960
message in the sequence diagram, the first interaction. Then the student

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,900
might submit the form and this is also a message

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,370
that goes to the registration form. At this point, when

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,440
the submission takes place, the registration form will send the

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,990
message, so it will invoke some functionality in the registration manager.

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,560
Specifically you will invoke the add course functionality

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,400
and pass Joe, the name of the student and

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,410
Math 101 which is the specific course for which

37
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,180
Joe is registering. Then the registration manager will ask

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,780
the Math 101 course whether it accepts registrations,

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,780
and the interaction will continue. So that Math 101

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,820
will actually check for a specific offering, if everything

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,070
goes fine, you will receive an ack, you'll send

42
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,180
back the act to the registration manager and so

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,650
on. Until at the end, Joe will be registered for

44
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,390
Math 101. As you can see, it is very

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,600
easy to see how the interaction occurs between these different

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,010
objects at run time, dynamically. So what the behavior

47
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,070
of the system is for this specific scenario. So the

48
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,780
last notational element that I want to add to this

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,350
diagram is the focus of control. Which is this tall

50
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,880
thin rectangle, that shows the period of time

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,190
that an object is performing an action, either

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,270
directly or indirectly. So if we look at

53
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,240
the registration form, this is telling us that

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,670
the registration form is active for this amount

55
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,170
of time. And the same thing we can

56
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,520
do for the registration manager, the Math 101

57
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,170
course offering, and the Math 101 specific section.
