00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,410
Let's now start talking about UML, the Unified Modeling Language.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,530
And we are going to start by looking at UML

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,390
structural diagrams. This are the diagrams that represent static characteristics

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,430
of the system that we need to model. This is

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,170
in contrast with dynamic models which instead behaviors of the

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,200
system that we need to model. And we will also

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,424
discuss dynamic models, later on in the lesson. We're going

8
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:25,670
to discuss several kinds of diagrams, starting from the class

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,228
diagram, which is a fundamental one in UML.

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,390
The class diagram represents a static, structural view of

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,190
the system, and it describes the classes and their

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,630
structure, and the relationships among classes in the system.
