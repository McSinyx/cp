1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,790
The next practice is simple design. We want to avoid

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,330
creating a huge complicated possibly cumbersome design at the beginning of

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,730
the project. What we want to have instead is just

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,580
enough design to meet the requirements, so no duplicated functionality, fewest

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,910
possible classes and methods in general, just the amount of

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,860
design that we need to get our system to work. So

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,012
one might object that to for designing that way we

8
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:25,210
will have to change the code a lot, we will need

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,300
to adapt the design as the code evolves,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,180
and that's exactly the point. That's what we will

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,670
do. XP is all about changing and adapting,

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,850
changing your design, changing your code, refactoring. And with

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,420
the fact that we have test cases throughout

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,770
the development process, we can do that with confidence.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,220
Because if we break something we will know

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,590
right away, which leads us to the next practice.
