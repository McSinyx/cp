00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,200
So I want to conclude this lesson by providing a high

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,790
level view of this scrum process. The process is represented here,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,939
and as you can see it has several components. We're going to

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,860
go through all of them one at a time. We're going to

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,110
start with a product backlog. Product backlog is the single source

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,420
of requirements, for the process. They're order by value raised priority

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,110
necessity, so that all of this characteristics can be taken into

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,920
account when selecting which backlog items to consider for the next iteration.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,710
It's a living list in the sense that backlog items

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,020
can be added or removed. And it's not really defined

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,200
as we just said, by the product owner. In the

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,260
sprint planning, what happens is that the next increment or

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,180
the next sprint is defined. So basically, the backlog items

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,348
of interest are selected based on the characteristics we just

15
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:46,890
mentioned: value, [UNKNOWN], priority, and necessity. And the items are

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,950
converted into tasks and estimated. So the result is this sprint

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,240
backlog, which is the set of backlog items that will

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,650
be completed during the next sprint. The sprint is an actual

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,040
iteration of this scrum process. It's got a main part

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,730
that lasts two to four weeks, and within this main part,

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,150
there are many daily scrums that last 24 hours. So

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,260
let's see how this work. A daily scrum is typically characterized

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,960
by a 50-minute meeting at the beginning of the day

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,220
for the team to sync, and what happens during the meeting

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,010
is that there is a discussion of the accomplishments since

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,210
the last meeting. A to do list for the next

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,210
meeting is produced, and there is also an obstacle analysis.

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,690
So if some problem appear, they're discussing the daily scrum, and

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,905
possible solutions are proposed. At the end of the two

30
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,840
four-week cycle, there is a sprint review and retrospective. The sprint

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,440
review normally consists of a four hour meeting. In the

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,270
meeting, the product owner assesses the accomplishment for the specific sprint,

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,020
and the team discusses issues that were encountered and solved.

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,530
There is typically a demo of the deliverable for that

35
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,810
sprint. And at that point, the product owner will also

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,610
discuss the backlogs. And together with the team they will decide

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,230
what to do next. In the retrospective conversely what happens

38
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,140
is there is more focus on the process. So the

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,010
goal of that part of the meeting is discussing possible

40
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,850
process improvements. To identify them

41
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,140
and if promising improvements are identified

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,810
try to plan how to implement those improvements and use them

43
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,790
in the next iterations. And something else that might happen at

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,720
the end of a sprint is that if the product increment

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,210
is good enough as it reach the state in which it

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,660
can be actually shipped that will result in a release that

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,730
is not just internal. To show the product owner the progress

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,510
that can also be deployed and actually used in production. So

49
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,650
one final consideration is that as you can see, XP and scrum

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,340
are fairly similar, and that's because they're both agile development

51
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,930
processes. So the main thing to keep in mind is that

52
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,620
they both implement and enforce

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,380
those ideas, values, practices, and characteristics

54
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,600
that we saw when we discussed agile development process in general.
