Now that we are done discussing XP Extreme Programming, I

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:04,612
would like to have a quiz, in which I make

3
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:06,772
sure that some of the concepts behind XP are well

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:10,040
understood. So, I'm going to ask you which of the following statements

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,390
about Extreme Programming are true, and here are the statements.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,700
Because of pair programming, XP requires twice the number of developers.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,260
In XP, code is rarely changed after being written. XP

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,200
follows the test driven development, or TDD, paradigm. The customer does

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,560
not need to provide any requirements in XP.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,120
XP is an iterative software development process. So I

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,700
would like for you to mark all of

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,020
the statements that you think are true about XP.
