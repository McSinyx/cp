1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,490
So now let's talk about a specific agile method, which

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,850
is also one of the first ones, extreme programming, also called

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,430
XP. And to introduce XP, I'm going to start with

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,520
a quote. The quote says XP is a lightweight methodology for

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,180
small to medium sized teams developing software in the face

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,770
of vague or rapidly-changing requirements. And this is a quote from

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,010
Kent Beck the American Software Engineer that created extreme programming.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,630
And by the way Beck was one of the original 17

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,570
developers who signed the manifesto in 2001. And as you can see

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,940
we are still talking about the methodology. So we are not just

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,760
talking about going out and just start writing software. There are principles.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,130
And there are practices that we need to follow, but we're going

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,330
to do it in a much more agile, and a much more

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,720
flexible ways than we did for our software processes. And also note

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,340
that the vague and rapidly changing

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,190
requirements are explicitly mentioned, because this

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,130
is really one of the important parts about all of this agile methodologies.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,780
so what is XP? XP is a. Lightweight. Humanistic.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,250
Discipline. Of software development. It is lightweight because it doesn't

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,190
overburden the developers with an invasive process. So process

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,510
is kept to a minimum. It's humanistic because as we

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,760
said, it's centered on people. People, developers, customers, are

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,520
at the center of the process. It's a discipline, as

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,870
we said, it includes practices that we to Follow.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,470
And finally, is of course about software development. Software development

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,530
is a key point of the whole method. In XP, developing

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,910
is like driving, imagine having a road, a wind road, we need

28
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,110
to able to drive our car down the road, take the

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,640
abrupt turns, react promptly to changes, for example obstacles on the road.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,610
So, in a nutshell, change is the only constant. Eyes always

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,980
have to be on the road and it's about steering and not

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,110
pointing, and XP is trying to do the same thing, while creating

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,190
softer systems. In XP we need to adopt a mentality of sufficiency,

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,820
what does that mean? How would you program if you had all

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,010
the time in the world? No time constraints at all, you will probably

36
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,090
write tests instead of skipping them, because there's no more resources. You

37
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,200
will probably restructure your code often,

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,210
because you see opportunities to improve it,

39
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,300
and you will take them. And you will probably talk to fellow

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,910
programmers and with the customer, interact with them, and this is actually the

41
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,700
kind of mentality that XP is trying to promote and agile processes

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,760
in general. And we will see that the following some of the practices

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,250
that XP is advocating, you can actually achieve these goals and you can

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,840
actually behave in this way. And the

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,010
development process is going to benefit overall.
