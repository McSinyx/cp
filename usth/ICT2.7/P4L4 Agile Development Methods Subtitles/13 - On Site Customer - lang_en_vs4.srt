1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,500
The last practice I want to mention is on-site customer, and what

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,590
that means is that literally the customer is an actual member of

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,310
the team. So the customer will sit with the team and will

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,546
bring requirements to the team and discuss the requirements with them. So

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,461
the typical objection to this practice is the fact that it's just

6
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:19,640
impossible in the real world. There is no way that the customer

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,550
can have one person staying with the team all the time, and

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,130
the answer to that objection is that if the system is not

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,700
worth the time of one customer then maybe the system is not worth building. In

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,530
other words, if you're investing tons of

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,440
dollars, tons of money in building a system,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,870
you might just as well invest a little more and have one of the people

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,080
in the customer's organization stay with the

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,450
team and be involved in the whole process.
