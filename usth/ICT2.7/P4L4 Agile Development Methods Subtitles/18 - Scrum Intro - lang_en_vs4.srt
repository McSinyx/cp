Before concluding this class on java development, I want to

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,330
talk about another process that is very popular these days, and

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,990
it's used in many companies, which is called Scrum. Which similar

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,370
to XP is another agile development process, and I'm going to

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,400
start by discussing what the Scrum actors are. There's three

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,490
main kinds of actors. The first one is the product owner,

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,590
which means the customer. The product owner is mainly responsible for

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,460
the product back log, where the product back log is basically

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,660
the list of things that have to be done, the

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,670
back log in fact for the project. And that is

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,640
analogous to the user stories to be realized in XP,

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,190
that we just saw. So what the product owner does is

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,310
to clearly express these back log items, and to also

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,680
order them by value, so they can be prioritized. The second

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,680
actor is the team. The team is responsible for delivering

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,012
shippable increments to estimate the

17
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,600
back log items. It's normally self-organized,

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,055
consists of four to nine people, and it's what you

19
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:56,180
would consider normally as the main development team in a

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,080
project. And finally we have the Scrum master. The Scrum

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,860
master is the person who's responsible for the overall Scrum process,

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,980
so he or she has to remove obstacles, facilitate events,

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,668
helps communications, and so on. So you you can see

24
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,013
the Scrum master as sort of a manager or the

25
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:15,059
person who's got oversight, or the supervisor of the Scrum process.
