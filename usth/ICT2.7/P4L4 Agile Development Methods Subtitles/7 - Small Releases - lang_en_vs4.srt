1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,790
The first practice that we just saw goes together with

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,320
small releases practice. This idea that instead of having a big

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,390
release at the end of a long development cycle, we try

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,610
to release very often. And there are many advantages to small

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,260
releases and to releasing often. The first one is that

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,980
we deliver real business value on a very short cycle. And

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,070
what that means is that we get business value sooner, and

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,550
that in turn increase our customer confidence and makes the customer

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,040
more happy. So more releases also mean rapid feedback. We

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,420
release the software soon, we get feedback from the customer soon,

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,710
and we can in this way do exactly what we

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,510
were saying before, steer instead of driving, adapt weekly to possible

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,680
changes in the requirements. We avoid working for six months

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,970
on a project and find out six months later that the

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,950
customer wanted something else and we got the wrong requirements. In

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,610
addition having small releases, so seeing your product deployed and released

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,040
soon produces a sense of accomplishment for the developers.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,000
And in addition, it also reduces risk because again,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,640
if we're going down the wrong path, we will

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,730
know right away. If we're late, we will know right

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,370
away. So these are just additional advantages of having

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,140
this quick cycle and more releases. And finally, as we

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,130
also said before, we can quickly adapt in the

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,540
case our requirements change our code to the new requirements.
