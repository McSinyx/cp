00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,880
In previous lessons, we covered testing principles and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,610
techniques. In this lesson, we will discuss a

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,550
type of software process that is heavily based

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,812
on the use of testing. The agile development

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:17,310
process. Also called test-driven development. To do that,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,290
we will revisit some of the assumptions that

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,490
led to the definition of the more traditional

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,030
software processes. The ones that we discussed so far.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,690
We will see how, when some of these assumptions are

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,210
no longer valid, we can change the way in which we

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,560
look at software processes. And we can change the way

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,120
in which we look at software development in general. We will

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,250
discuss how this changing perspective, lets us rethink software processes

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,520
and make them more agile and better suited for context in

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,120
which changes are the norm and we need to adapt

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,535
fast. In particular, we will discuss two processes that apply the

17
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:53,570
principles of agile software development and that are commonly

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,170
used in industry. Extreme programming, also called XP, and Scrum.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,560
