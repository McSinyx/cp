1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,600
The first statement is false. It is not true

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,840
that because of pair programming, we need twice as many

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,039
developers. In fact that there is some evidence that even

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,700
though in pair programming we have two developers working together,

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,175
that the overall efficiency of the programmers is not really

6
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:19,080
affected by use of this practice. In XP, code is

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,280
rarely changed after being written. This is also definitely false.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,233
In fact in XP there is a lot of emphasis

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,879
on change on the fact that the code can be changed,

10
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,462
it can be resigned, because of the fact when we do

11
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,793
that, we have a set of these cases that we can

12
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:35,439
use to check right away that the code still works as

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,850
expected. So again in XP, it's all about steering rather than

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,430
just driving down one fixed direction. And therefore, the code can

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,580
be changed. So this statement is false. It is definitely true

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,950
that XP follows the test driven development paradigm. In XP we first

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,320
write tests, and then we write the code, which is

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,980
exactly what TDD is about. It is not true that

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,740
the customer does not need to provide requirements in XP.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,020
The customer does provide requirements in the form of user

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,879
stories, and the user stories are the starting point of

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,370
the development process. Finally, XP is definitely an iterative software

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,500
development process. In fact, we saw that XP is based

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,100
on subsequent iterations of the same cycle, in which we

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,110
select from a set of story cards, or user

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,270
stories, the stories that we want to implement in the

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,250
next iteration. Based on that we develop task cards,

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,060
and then we use the task cards to write this

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,400
case and then to write code. And we continue

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,140
this cycle in an iterative way until we are done

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,030
with all the story cards, and all the user

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,612
stories, so definitely XP is an iterative software development process.
