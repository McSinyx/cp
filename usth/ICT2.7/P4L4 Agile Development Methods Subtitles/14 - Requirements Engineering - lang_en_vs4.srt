00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,680
Now that we saw what the main values and practices

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,200
of XP are, I want to go back for a minute

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,800
to discussion of requirements engineering in XP. In XP, user

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,180
requirements are expressed as scenarios or user stories, as we already

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,500
discussed. These are written by customers on cards, and what

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,550
the development team does is to take these cards, take these

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,240
users stories and break them down into implementation tasks. And

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,310
those implementation tasks are then used as a basis for scheduling

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,210
cost estimates. So given these estimates, and based on their priorities,

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,770
the customer will choose the stories that will be included in

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,980
the next release, in the next iteration. And at this point,

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,220
the corresponding cards will be taken by the developers and the,

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,380
the task will be performed, and the relative, and the corresponding

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,350
card will be developed. And just to give an idea of

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,330
the order of magnitude, if you consider a few months project,

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,390
there might be 50 to 100 user stories for a project of

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,820
that duration. So, now let me give you an example of what

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,630
the story card might look like, and I'm going to do it using

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,930
a story card for document downloading and you can really do all of

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,780
this, basically as seeing what the

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,440
scenario is, downloading and printing an article.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,590
And it describes basically what happens when you do that, what is

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,530
the scenario. First, you select the article that you want from a displayed

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,760
list. You then have to tell the system how you will pay for

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,680
it. This can either be through a subscription, through a company account or

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,670
by credit card, and so on. So what developers do, they take

27
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,020
this story card, and they break it down in to development tasks.

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,100
So, here I'm showing you some examples of task cards for the

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,360
user story that we just saw. In particular I'm showing three task cards

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,740
and if we look at the third one, there is a name

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,260
for the task, which is implement payment collection. So this is the development

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,600
task that we have the perform and here, there's a description of

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,240
what that developed code should do. And notice that, you know, the task

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,400
card can even be more. explicit than this, more

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,450
specific than this, and talk about actual development tasks.
