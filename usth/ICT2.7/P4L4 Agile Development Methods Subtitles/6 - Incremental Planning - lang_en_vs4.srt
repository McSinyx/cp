1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,390
Incremental planning is based on the idea that requirements are recorded

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,260
on story cards, sort of use cases or scenarios that the customer

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,450
provides. So the first step in incremental planning is to select

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,120
user stories for a given release, and which stories exactly to include

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,975
depends on the time available and on the priority. For example,

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,147
scenarios that we might want to realize right away because they are

7
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:22,110
particular important for the customer. After we select user stories for

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,200
the release, we break stories i to tasks. So what we do,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,260
we take the user stories and we identify specific development tasks

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,320
that we need to perform in order to realize these stories. Once

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,780
we know our tasks, we can plan our release. And at

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,050
that point, we can develop, integrate and test our code. And of

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,170
course, this is more kind of an iterative process right here,

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,250
so we do this many times. When we're ready, when we accomplish

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,990
all of our tasks, all of our tests pass and we're happy,

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,410
we release this software. At the point, the released software is evaluated

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,250
by us, by the customer, and we can reiterate. We can

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,360
continue the process, select more stories and continue it this way.
