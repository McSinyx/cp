1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,320
So now let's go back to our split example. Let me

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,790
rearrange things a little bit to make more room. So now I'm

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,160
going to put the domains for size and for strength one next to

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,210
the other. So let's look at what some possible inputs will be

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,140
for the sub domains that we identified when we use the idea

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,790
of selecting input of the boundary. If we look at the first

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,860
subdomain, size less than zero, one reasonable input is, size equals to

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,360
minus 1, because minus 1 is the boundary value for the domain

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,530
of the integers less than zero. If we look at the third

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,119
subdomain, possibly interesting case is the one of size of equal to

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,900
1, for the same reasoning that we used for the previous subdomain,

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,670
for size less than zero. And, let's try to select another one

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,870
for this subdomain, for the integers greater than zero. If there is

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,200
a concept of maximal integer, we can select that one as our

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,140
boundary value. And of course we could select much more, but this

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,630
is just to give you an idea. Other possible inputs. One interesting

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,310
example for the first one, string with length less than

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,690
size will be a string with length size minus one. Again

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,240
this is the boundary value for this domain. And we could

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,500
continue in this way like for example selecting a string who's

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,310
length is exactly size as a boundary value for this

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,490
other domain. Instant one, and we look back actually to this

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,940
example and look at it in a more extensive way when

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,690
we actually talk about a specific method for doing this kind

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,340
of process.
