1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,590
So let's go back again to our domain, with

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,580
all the sub-domains identified. And the basic idea, or the

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,750
intuitive idea I was talking about, is that errors tend

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,425
to occur at the boundary of a domain, or a

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:15,510
sub-domain. Like in this case. And why? Because these

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,360
are the cases that are less understood by the developers.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,155
Like for example, the last iteration of a loop, or

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,150
a special value like zero for integers. So if this

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,590
is true, what we want to do is to select inputs at these

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,189
boundaries. And this is complementary to partition

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,270
testing, in the sense that partition testing

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,160
will identify the partitions in which we want to select inputs, and boundary

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,570
testing. So the selection of boundary values

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,060
will help select inputs in these partitions.
