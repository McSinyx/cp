1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,980
In the second step of the category partition technique, the goal is

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,630
to Identify Categories. Where categories are

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,650
characteristics of each input element. So

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,490
let me illustrate what that means using an example. And to do

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,440
that I'm going to use again the example of the split program, as

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,830
we are already familiar with it and we kind of already played

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,110
with it. When we were talking about the generic black box approach.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,293
So let me bring back the program, and let me remind you

9
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:25,440
that what the program does is to take two inputs, a string and

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
the size, and it breaks down the string into chunks,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,300
whose length is size. If we look at the split program

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,330
there are two input elements, str and size so we going to

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,930
identify categories for these two. So starting from str, what are

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,228
the interesting characteristics of the string? In, in this step

15
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:44,948
you're going to use your domain knowledge, your understanding of what a

16
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:47,986
string is, and for example we might identify the length of

17
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:50,528
the string and the content of the string as the two

18
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,840
main characteristics that we want to focus on. If we now

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,540
move our focus to size, the only characteristic I can really

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,340
think of for an integer is its value. So that's what

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,470
I'm going to mark here. So at the end of the step

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,030
what we have is that we have two categories. So two

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,930
interesting characteristics for the string input str, which are the length

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,940
and the content. And one category for the integer input size

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,480
which is its value. And notice that there's not only one solution.

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,200
So there's not only one possibility.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,384
So that the specific characteristics that you

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,800
will identify are somehow subjective. But the

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,630
important point is that you identify characteristics

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,259
that are meaningful and they sort of cover the main aspects of the

31
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,200
inputs, which is the case for the

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,440
categories that we've identified in this example.
