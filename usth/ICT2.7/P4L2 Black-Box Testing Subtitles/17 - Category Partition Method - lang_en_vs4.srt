00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,690
What we will discuss next is a specific black-box testing

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,240
approach. So a specific instance of the general approach that

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,814
we just saw. And this approach is the category-partition method,

4
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:13,418
and was defined by Ostrand &amp; Balcer in 1988 in

5
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:16,760
an article to the peer [UNKNOWN] communication of the ACM.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,490
So this is a method for going from a specification,

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,370
a description of the system, to a set of test

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,170
cases like any other black-box testing approach by following six steps.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,370
So let's look at what these steps are. The first

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,850
step is to identify independently testable features and this is

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,870
a step that we are familiar with because its exactly

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,950
the same step that we performed in the generic black box

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,480
testing approach that we just discussed. The second step is

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,250
to identify categories. Then the next step is to partition

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,070
categories into choices. Identify constraints

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,530
among choices. Produce and evaluate

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,330
test case specifications. And finally, the sixth step is to generate

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,100
test cases from test case specifications. So two of

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,970
the key elements in these six steps are the two

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,430
that give the name to the technique so the identification

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,240
of the categories and the partition of these categories into

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,810
choices. What we're going to do next is to go

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,670
and look at each one of the steps independently, except

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,285
for the first one. Because we're already familiar with that

25
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:12,650
step, and this method doesn't really add much to it.
