1
00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,935
So we get to the last step of the technique in

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,142
which once we have generated test case specifications. We create test

3
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:09,180
cases starting from this specifications. This step mainly consists in a

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,840
simple instantiation of frames and it's final result is a set of

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,840
concrete tests. For our example, test frame number 36 that we

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,270
just saw, this will be the resulting test case, which has

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,490
the same ID, so that we can track it and will

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,520
specify to concrete values, not just the specification for the input elements.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,130
So string STR will have this value. And the integer size

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,720
will have this value. And these two values satisfy what this

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,260
test case specification was. Which was, having a string contain special

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,760
characters. Here, we have two special characters, like the new line

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,900
and the tab. And, we have a size which is greater

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,430
than zero, in particular, okay? And this is a test case

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,880
that we can actually run on our code. That we can

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,730
run on the split program. So, to summarize, we perform six steps

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,400
in which we went from a high level description of what the program does, to a

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,070
set of concrete test cases. And this is

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,880
one of those test cases. So what, what we're

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,210
going to do next, we're going to do a mini-demo,

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,260
in which we do this for real. We take

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,440
the program, we identify categories, choices, constraints, and

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,800
we actually generate test frames and then test cases.
