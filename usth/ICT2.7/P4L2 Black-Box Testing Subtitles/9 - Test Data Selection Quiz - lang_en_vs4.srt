00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,180
So I'm going to ask you something. Which is if

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,750
we consider again our function print sum, the one

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,760
that takes two integers and prints the sum. How

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,300
long would it take to exhaustively test this function? And

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,950
this is a very simple one. There's just two

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,240
inputs, right? So we can just enumerate them all.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,950
And put them throw them at the computer form,

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,440
and wait for the results. How long would that take?
