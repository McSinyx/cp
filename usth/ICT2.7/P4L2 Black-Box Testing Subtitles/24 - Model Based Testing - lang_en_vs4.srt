00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,950
What we just saw with the category-partition method, is a

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,530
specific instance of this systematic

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,230
functional testing approach. So specific instance

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,900
of the steps that we represented here. And, as I

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,100
mentioned earlier on, this is not the only way in which

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,700
you can generate test cases, starting from a functional specification.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,190
In particular, this step, in which we identified relevant inputs and

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,390
then we combine them to generate test case specifications, can also

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,490
be done in different ways. And, we're going to look at one

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,170
of these ways. Which is through the construction of a

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,040
model. And, the reason why I want to talk about models.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,090
Is because, model based testing is also, fairly popular in

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,680
industry. And fairly used in practice. In model based testing, the

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,150
way in which we go from specifications, to test cases,

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,220
is through the construction of a model. Where a model is

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,670
an abstract representation of the software under test. Also in

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,860
this case there are many possible models, that we can use.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,180
And what we're going to do, we're going to focus

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,370
on a specific kind of model. And I'll

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,010
just point you to additional sources of information,

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,070
in case you're interested in seeing other examples.
