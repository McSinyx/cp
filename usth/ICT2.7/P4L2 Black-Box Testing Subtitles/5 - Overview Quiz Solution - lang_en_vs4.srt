00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,760
Sum is a very simple program, that only does one thing,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,540
summing two number, adding two numbers. So the answer in this

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,640
case, it's one. There's only one feature that we can test

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,060
in PrintSum. So let's look at the slightly more interesting example.
