1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,250
Now we move to the next step, which involves partitioning the

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,680
categories that we just identified into choices. And these choices are the

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,930
interesting cases for each category. So the interesting subdomains for each one

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,810
of these categories. So once more, lets look at that using our

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,110
example, the split program. So lets start by considering length. What are

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,710
the interesting cases when we think about the length of a string?

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,220
Some of those we already saw, one interesting case is the case

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,190
of the length of size zero, so a string with no characters.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,030
Another interesting case is the one in which the length of the

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,780
string is size minus one, so the string is just one character

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,610
short of the size at which it will be cut by the

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,160
split program. And we can continue along these lines, so we will select

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,950
size, size plus one, size twice the value of size minus one,

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,560
and so on and so forth. But even without listing all of

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,500
those, I'm sure you get the idea of what it means to

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,780
identify this interesting cases. Let's see

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,702
the movements that are considering the content.

18
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,990
So without the interesting cases when we think about the content

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,520
of the string. So possible interesting case is the string that

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,660
contains only spaces. Why? Well maybe because a split is written

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,290
spaces in a special way. Similarly a string that contains special

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,780
characters, like non printable characters,

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,020
like tabulation characters, new line might

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,240
also be an interesting case, something that we want to test. Also

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
in this case we could continue and go on and on.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,250
So basically here you just want to put all the interesting cases

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,010
that you can think of when you consider the content

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,440
of a string. Now let's move to the value as the

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,740
next category. So the value of the input size. And

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,280
here we might want to consider a size zero, special case, a

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,640
normal situation, like size greater than zero, another special case,

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,420
size less than zero or maxint. And these are, if you

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,420
remember, I accepted the cases that we consider when we look

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,350
at this example, before. And also here we can continue and

35
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,970
go on and on. So, at the end of the

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,860
step, what we have is a set of interesting cases

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,220
for each one of the categories, and now we can

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,150
start to think about how we want to combine them.
