00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,600
Now we are at the end of this lesson, and I

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,450
just want to wrap it up by summarizing what we've seen. We talked

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,340
about black-box testing, the testing of

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,760
software based on a functional specification,

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,510
a description of the software rather than its code. We saw a

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,500
systematic way of doing that, that allows for breaking down the problem

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,140
of testing software, so the problem of going from this functional specification

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,540
to a set of test cases into smaller steps, more manageable steps.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,466
And we saw two main ways of doing this. One by identifying

10
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,304
relevant inputs for the main features in the system

11
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:31,802
and then deriving test case specifications and test cases from

12
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:34,180
this set of inputs. And the second way by

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,780
building a model for the main features of the system

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,210
and then using this model to decide how to

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,680
test the system. In the next lesson, we are going

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,440
to discuss, how to do testing by looking inside the

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,716
box? So, how to do testing in a white-box fashion.
