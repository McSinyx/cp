00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,780
So, now I want to do a little quiz about

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,530
identifying testable features. Let's consider

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,700
this simple problem called printSum.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,680
We won't see the implementation because we are doing black-box

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,780
testing. And all we need to know is that printSum takes

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,550
two integers, a and b, and prints the sum of

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,540
these two numbers. So what I want to ask, is

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,700
how many independently testable features do we have here? Do

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,860
we have one, two, three features? Or more than three features?
