00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,620
In the previous lesson, we discussed the fundamental

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,380
concepts behind software verification in general, and software testing

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,470
in particular. In this lesson, we will discuss

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,310
one of the two main testing approaches. Black box

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,180
testing, also called functional testing. We will cover

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,180
the main characteristic of black box testing, its pros

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,260
and cons, and discuss some commonly used black

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,350
box testing techniques. We will conclude the lesson with

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,520
a practical exercise in which we will apply a specific black

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,520
box testing technique to a real program. We will derive test

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,980
cases for the program and assess how the use of a

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,690
systematic approach, in contrast to a brute force approach, can help.
