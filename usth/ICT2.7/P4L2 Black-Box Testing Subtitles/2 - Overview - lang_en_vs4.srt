As we said at the end of the previous lesson, black-box testing is

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,230
the testing of the software when we look at it as a black box,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,110
as a closed box, without looking at it inside, without looking at the

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,750
code. And there are several advantages in

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,680
using black-box testing. So let me recap

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,590
those advantages, some of which we already mentioned, and let me also expand

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,220
on that a little bit. The first advantage of when I mentioned is that

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,760
black box focuses on the domain, on the input domain of the software. And

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,750
as such, we can use it to make sure that we are actually covering

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,400
this domain, that we are actually covering the important behaviors of

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,200
the software. A second advantage is that black box testing does not

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,402
need the code. What that means is that you can perform early

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,801
test design. So you can start designing and writing your test cases,

14
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,423
even before writing your code, so that when the code is

15
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:44,520
ready, we can test it right away. And that helps prevent a

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,054
problem that is very typical in real life software development, which is

17
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:50,790
getting an idea of the project and having no time to create

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,040
the tests. In this way, we already have the tests, so

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,170
we just have to run them. Another advantage is that black-box testing

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,530
can catch logic defects, because it focuses on the description of what

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,440
the software should do, and therefore on its logic. If we derive

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,250
test cases from such description, then we can catch these kind of

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,510
problems. And finally, black-box testing is

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,900
applicable at all granularity levels, which

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,490
means that we can use black-box testing in unit testing, integration testing,

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,290
system testing, and so on. We can use it at all levels.
