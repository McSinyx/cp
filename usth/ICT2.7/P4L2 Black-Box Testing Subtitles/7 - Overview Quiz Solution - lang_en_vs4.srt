1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,030
In this case there's not really a right answer because there's

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,750
many, many features that you could identify in a piece of

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,655
software as complex as a, a spreadsheet. So I'm just going

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:11,900
to give you three examples. So one could be the cell merging

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,950
operation. So the operation in which we merge two cells in

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,550
the spreadsheet. Another example could be chart creation, so I might want

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,370
to test the feature that allows you to create charts in

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,310
your spreadsheets. Yet another example could

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,540
be the test of statistical functions,

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,350
so the function that allows you to do various statistical calculations on

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,650
the numbers in your cells. And as I said there's many, many

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,900
more example that we could use. But the key thing I want

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,770
to convey here is the fact that there is no way you

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,020
can look at a spreadsheet with all the functionality that it provides

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,160
and just go and test it. The first step, what you need

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,430
to do first, is to identify which ones are the pieces of

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,620
functionality that I can test individually. So that's why this is the

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,310
first step in black-box testing.
