00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,080
Now before we move to the last part of the lesson, let's

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,939
have a quick quiz on software process models to make sure that

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,640
we are all on the same page. So I am going to

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
ask you two questions. The first question is which of the following models

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,330
is most suitable to develop a software control system? And when you

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,700
think about the software control system, you can think about for example

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,150
the control system for the software in an airplane. Would you rather

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,860
use a pure waterfall model? Test

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,840
driven development? Or an evolutionary prototyping approach?
