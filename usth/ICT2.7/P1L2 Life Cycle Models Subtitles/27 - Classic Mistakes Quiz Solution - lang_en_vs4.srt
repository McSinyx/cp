1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,719
You probably got this one right. The right answer is that

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,330
this is a people mistake. And despite the fact that this is

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,550
an easy answer, I just want to make sure to stress

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,800
once more. Because this is a very classic mistake. And one that

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,070
can have dire consequences. You should never add people, to a

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,430
late project. Because in 99.9% of the cases, that's only going to make

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,390
things worse. Why? Because these people have to be brought up to

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,590
speed, and also because having more also makes the communication more difficult,

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,690
the meetings more difficult and so on. So in

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,980
short, do not add people to a late project.
