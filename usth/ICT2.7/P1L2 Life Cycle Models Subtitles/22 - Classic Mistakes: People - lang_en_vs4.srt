1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,000
Now we get to the final part of the lesson.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,810
And in this part I want to talk about well known,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,230
ineffective development practices. These practices, when followed, tend to lead

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,245
to predictably bad results. So let's look at some examples of

5
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:17,130
these classic mistakes. And we're going to start with mistakes

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,660
involving people. And notice that there is a long list. So

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,100
I'm going to discuss just a few of those mistakes.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,215
And I'm going to point you to more information on this

9
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,550
topic in the class notes. And some of these mistakes are

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,020
actually kind of entertaining. So I'll recommend that you look at

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,210
the class notes and go in more depth in this list.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,550
So the first people mistake I want to mention is the

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,945
one that I define, heroics. And this refers to too much

14
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:43,480
emphasis on can do attitudes, so this idea that one person

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,330
by himself or by herself can do everything and can make

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,422
the difference in the whole project. And unfortunately, this encourages extreme

17
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,950
risk taking and discourages cooperation, which is plain bad for

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,610
the project. For example, it might force people not to

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,600
report schedule slips. It might force people to take on

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,210
on too much responsibility. And normally, and I saw it

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,600
happen many times, the final result is a failure. So

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,410
what you want when you're developing a larger project, is

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,710
actually to apply soft engineering principles. Have teams, have team

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,580
work, and have cooperation among the different team members, without pointing

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,830
too much on single individuals. Another classic mistake

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,140
is to not create the right working environment. We

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,900
all like to work in nice environments. And there

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,790
is strong evidence that the working environments can play

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,670
a big role in productivity. There is evidence

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,280
that productivity increases when the workplace is nice, quiet,

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,950
warm, and welcoming. Finally, some of the most important

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,480
people relating mistakes are due to poor people management.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,540
For example, lack of leaderships, or leadership that is

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,920
exercised using the wrong means in the wrong way, which

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,280
can lead to very unhappy personnel and therefore, low

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,190
productivity, or even people leaving teams. Another classic example of

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,370
poor management is adding people to a project that

38
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,600
is behind schedule, which never works. Why it doesn't work?

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Because these new people need to be brought up to

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,520
speed, and that causes further delays rather than improving the

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,280
situation with the project schedule.
