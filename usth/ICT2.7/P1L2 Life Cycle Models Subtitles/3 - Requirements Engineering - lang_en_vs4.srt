1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,200
So, let's start with requirements engineering, which is the

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,560
field within software engineering that deals with establishing the

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,400
needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,480
the software. So why is this phase so important?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,350
In general, the cost of correcting an error depends

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,060
on the number of subsequent decisions that are based

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,160
on it. Therefore, errors made in understanding requirements have

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,670
the potential for greatest cost because many other design decisions

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,020
depend on them and many other follow up decisions depend on them.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,510
In fact, if we look at this diagram, which is again a

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,210
qualitative diagram, where we have the cost of error correction over the

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,780
phase in which the error is discovered. We can see that if we

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,420
discover an error in requirements it's going to cost us one. If

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,020
we find it in in design it's going to cost us five and

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,410
so on and so forth. And the cost grows dramatically as we

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,960
go from the requirements phase to the maintenance phase. Why? Because of course

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,092
if we discover a problem here we're left to undo a

18
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:55,536
lot of the decision that we had made before to correct the

19
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:58,019
error. Whereas if we find an error here we can correct it

20
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,380
right away and we don't affect the subsequent phases. So how can

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,540
we collect the right requirements. Traditional

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,310
requirements in engineering does so through

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,930
a set of steps. The first step is elicitation which is the

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,840
collection of requirements from stake holders and other sources and can be

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,890
done in a variety of ways, we will discuss some of them.

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,280
The second is requirement analysis which involved the study and

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
deeper understanding of the collective requirements. The third step is this

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,760
specification of requirements, in which the collective requirements are suitably

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,730
represented, organized and save so that they can be shared. Also

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,530
in his case, there are many ways to do this,

31
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,350
and we will see some of this ways when we talk

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,550
about the requirements engineering in the dedicated lesson. Once the

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,970
requirements have been specified, they can be validated to make sure

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,420
that they're complete, consistent, no redundant and so on. So

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,460
that they've satisfied a set of importance properties, for requirements.

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,410
Finally, the fifth step is requirements management which accounts for

37
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,100
changes to requirements during the lifetime of the project. And here

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,330
I talked about steps, kind of giving the impression that

39
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,310
we're just going from the first step to the fifth one

40
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,300
and that this is sort of a linear process. In

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,990
reality, as we will see, this is more of an iterative

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,690
process in which will go and cover the different phases in an

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,560
iterative fashion. We will discuss extensively

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,453
requirements engineering in our second mini-course.
