00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,360
The final type of classic mistakes that I want

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,470
to mention are technology related mistakes. One typical mistake

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,990
in this context is the silver-bullet syndrome. What does

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,340
that mean? Well, the silver-bullet syndrome refers to situations

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,900
in which there is too much reliance on the

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,950
advertised benefits of some previously unused technology. For example,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,980
a new technology. And the problem here is that

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,140
we cannot expect technology alone to solve our software

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,810
development issues. So we should not rely too

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,020
much on technology alone. Another typical mistake is to

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,700
switch or add tools in the middle of

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,010
a project. And sometimes it can make sense to

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,620
upgrade a tool, but introducing new tools, which

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,650
can have a steep learning curve, has almost always

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,290
negative effects. Finally, a common unforgivable mistake is

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,230
the lack of an automated version control system for

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,480
your code and for your various artifacts. Manual and

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,700
ad hoc solutions are just not an option. It is

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,270
way too easy to make mistakes, use out of

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,600
date versions, be unable to find a previous working version,

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,030
and so on. I saw that happening many times,

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,640
and it always results in a disaster. So be warned,

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,650
use a version control system and an automated one. And

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,750
actually we will use version control systems in our projects.
