1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,770
Another type of classic mistakes are process-related mistakes. And also

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,850
in this case, these kind of mistakes can be due

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,970
to many reasons. And they are of many types. One

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,310
typical example are scheduling issues, which are due to the fact

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,180
of being unable to come up with a realistic schedule.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,750
So to have an overly optimistic schedule. And this can be

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,230
because we underestimate the effort involved in different parts of

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,010
the project. Because we overestimate the ability of the people involved.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,600
Because we overestimate the importance, for example, of the use

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,640
of tools. But no matter what the reason is, the

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,840
result is typically that the projects end up being late,

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,580
which is a very common situation. So this is somehow

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,020
related to planning. And in general, planning is a fundamental

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,720
factor in software processes and in software development. Mistakes in

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,120
planning, such as insufficient planning or abandoning planning due to

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,190
pressure, usually lead inexorably to failure. And speaking of failures,

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,040
often there are unforeseen failures. Such as

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,410
failures on the constructor's end, for example,

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,920
that might lead to low quality or

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,580
late deliverables, which ultimately affects the downstream activities.
