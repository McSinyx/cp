00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,550
After we have built our system, verification and validation

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,970
is that phase of software development that aims to

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,000
check that the software system meets its specification and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,800
fulfills its intended purpose. More precisely, we can look

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,250
at verification and validation independently. And validation is the

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,100
activity that answers the question did we build the

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,420
right system. Did we build the system that the

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,030
customer wants? That will make the customer happy. Whereas verification

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,730
answers a different question which is did we build the system

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,410
right. So given a description of the system that is the one

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,280
that we derived from the customer through the collection of requirements

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,130
and then design and so on, did we build a system that

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,150
actually implements the specification that we defined? And when we look

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,600
at verification there's many, many ways of doing verification and in fact

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,430
in the mini course number four we will cover verification extensively. The

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,100
only thing I want to mention here is the fact that verification

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,110
can be performed at different levels. In particular, it can be

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,810
performed at the unit level in which we test that the individual

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,520
units work as a expected. Can be performed in the integration level

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,525
in which what we test is the interaction between the different units.

21
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,630
So we want to make sure that the different modules talk

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,720
to each other in the right way. And finally, there is system

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,440
testing in which we test the system as a whole and we

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,170
want to make sure that all the system, all the different pieces

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,010
of the system work together in the right

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,160
way. And this is also the level at which

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,360
then we will apply validation and some other

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,770
testing techniques like stress testing or robustness testing and

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,890
so on. And as I said I'm not going to say anything more on this topic because

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,760
we will cover verification, and validation, and testing in

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,667
particular in great details in mini course number four.
