00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,650
As we just heard from Professor Bohem, software

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,970
engineering is an important and critical discipline, concerned

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,100
with cost effective software development. We also heard

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,170
that this is based on a systematic approach

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,580
that uses appropriate tools and techniques, operates under

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,130
specific development constraints. And most importantly, follows a

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,890
process. As we discussed in the previous lesson,

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,770
the software development process contains fundamental activities, or phases.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,480
Since we will discuss several processes, I'm going to remind

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,150
you what these phases are. We start with requirements

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,630
engineering, followed by design,

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,980
implementation, verification and validation, and

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,950
finally maintenance. Note that we will revisit each of

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,940
these phases and devote an entire lesson or more

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,160
to each phase. So what I want to do next

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,210
is simply to give you a quick overview of

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,020
what these phases are. Note also that for now

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,330
I will follow a very traditional take on these topics. Later on in the

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,260
class we will see how things can change and did change over the years.
