1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,860
We just saw several software process models, and there

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,330
are many, many more. And because these process models define

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,330
the master plan for our project, the specific process

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,220
model that we choose has as much influence over a

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,700
project's success as any other major planning decision that

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,610
we make. Therefore, it is very important that we pick

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,100
the appropriate model for our development process. Picking an appropriate

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,100
model can ensure the success of a project. On the

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,830
contrary, if we choose the wrong model, that can be a

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,010
constant source of problems and ultimately, it can make the project

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,830
fail. So how can we choose the right model for a

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,310
project? To be able to do so, we have to take into

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,490
consideration many factors. In particular, we need to be aware of

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,390
what level of understanding we have of the requirements. Do we understand

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,720
all the requirements? Are we going to be able to collect all

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,430
the requirements in advance, or collecting requirements is going to be hard and

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,460
therefore, we might want to follow a process that is more flexible

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,470
with that respect. Another important point is the expected lifetime of the

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,300
project. Is this a quick project that we are putting together for

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,100
a specific purpose or something that's going to last for for a number

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,910
of years and that we're going to maintain over all those years?

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,380
That's going to make a difference in the way we decide to develop

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,190
that project. Also, what is the level of risk involved? Do we

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,530
know the domain very well? Do we know exactly the technologies involved?

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,100
Well, if so, we might go with a more traditional process. Otherwise,

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,902
we might want to be more agile, more flexible. It is also

27
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:24,900
very important to know the schedule constraints. How much time, how many

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,640
resources do we have for this project? What is the expected interaction

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,870
with the management and the customer? In particular for this ladder, there

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,840
are many processes that rely on the fact that there can be

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,310
a continuous interaction with the customer. If that interaction is not there,

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,230
there's no way we are going to be able to use these processes.

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,580
Conversely, there are processes that don't require the presence of the customer

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,868
at all, except for the initial phase and maybe some checking points and

35
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,020
so if the customer is very inaccessible, we might want to follow

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,740
one of those processes, instead of one of the more demanding ones in

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,340
terms of customer's time. Finally, it is important to take into account

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,450
the level of the expertise of the people involved. Do we have people

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,730
that know the technologies that we're using? Do we know people that

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,590
know a specific kind of process?

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,930
Some processes require some specific expertise and

42
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,320
we're not going to be able to follow that process if we don't

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,410
have the right expertise. So we need to take into account all of

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,570
these aspects, and sometimes more, in order to be able to make

45
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,560
the right decision and pick the right software process model for our project.
