To conclude this lesson, I'm going to have a

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,650
simple quiz and what I'm going to ask you

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,950
is, which kind of mistake adding people to a late project is? And you can pick

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,540
between a people mistake, a product mistake, a

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,830
technology mistake, or maybe this is not a

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,800
mistake at all, it is actually okay to add people to a project that is late.
