1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,860
In this case, I think about the spiral model,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,610
and evolutionary prototyping model will work. Definitely you don't want to

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,110
have a pure water from water. Why? Well because it

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,940
is very expensive with a pure waterfall model to make

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,460
changes during the course of the project, especially changes

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,860
that involve requirements. Why? Because we saw that it can

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,440
be very expensive. Whereas with the spiral model, we saw

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,220
that being iterative, we can actually make correction throughout development.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,840
Similarly, with evolutionary prototyping, we keep evolving our system

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,170
based on the customer feedback. And therefore, if something changes,

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,810
we will get feedback right away, and we will

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,230
be able to adapt. So the key thing here is

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,060
that anything that is iterative works better in the

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,400
case of changing environments. So, situations in which your requirements,

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,720
the situation, the project might change. Whereas waterfall is

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,410
more appropriate for situations in which the requirements are stable,

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,760
we know the domain, and possibly we also know the technologies involved.
