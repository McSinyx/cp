00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,590
Okay. Now before we jump into the next

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,780
topic, I just want to take a very quick and

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,630
simple quiz just to make sure that you

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,236
guys paid attention to what I just discussed. So

5
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:10,820
I want to ask you what are the traditional

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,200
software phases. Requirements engineering,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,079
design, abstraction, implementation, verification and

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,020
validation. Or maybe design,

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,830
optimization, implementation verification and validation

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,448
and maintenance. Or requirements

11
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:24,892
engineering, design, implementation, verification and

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,290
validation, and maintenance.
