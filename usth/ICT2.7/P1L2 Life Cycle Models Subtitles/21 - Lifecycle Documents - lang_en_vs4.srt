00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,650
Now that we discussed softer process models, there is

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,100
another important point I want to cover, because it's going to

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,970
be useful for your projects. Documenting the activities carried out

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,660
during the different phases of the softer lifecycle, is a

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,960
very important task. The documents that we produce are used

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,270
for different purposes, such as communicative details of the software

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,650
systems. To difference the colors, ensure the correct implementation of

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,630
the system, facilitate maintenance, and so on. There are standardized

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,230
document that are provided by IEEE that you can use

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,680
for this purpose. However, they're kind of heavyweight. So for the

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,090
project in this class, when we will need them, I will

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,760
rather use this lightweight documents. That we created by modifying the

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,730
original ones, and make them a little simpler. In this,

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,700
our documents are actually used, while teaching this class in the

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,600
past. So they're well tested and work well for the kind

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,730
of projects that we will perform. I provide information on how

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,880
to access these documents in the class notes.
