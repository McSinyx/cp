1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,980
This is the context in which, typically, a pure

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,310
waterfall process will work well. Why? Well, because it's a

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,160
context in which requirements are usually well understood. The

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,020
domain is well understood, so that kind of system has

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,900
been built many times before. And also, it's a

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,510
system in which we don't expect requirements to change dramatically

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,180
over time. Therefore, a waterfall model, in which we collect

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,140
all the requirements at the beginning and then we move

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,280
to the subsequent phases might be the most appropriate one. Probably

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,800
we don't want to do evolutionary prototyping in the case of

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,130
the control system for an airplane. Same thing holds for TDD,

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,460
so we want to be a little more rigorous in those cases.
