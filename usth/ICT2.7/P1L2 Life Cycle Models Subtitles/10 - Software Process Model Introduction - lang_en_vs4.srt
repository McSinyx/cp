1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,600
At this point, you know the possible activities, the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,520
possible phases performed during the software development process. But there

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,710
this something that we still haven't discussed, which is

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,910
very important. And that is how should we put these

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,990
activities together to develop software? And this all comes

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,360
down to the concept of software process model. Also called

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,520
software lifecycle model. And what this is, is a

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,470
prescriptive model of what should happen from the very beginning

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,960
to the very end. Of a software development process. The

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,360
main function of the life cycle model is to determine

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,290
the order of the different activities so that we know

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,920
which activities should come first and which ones should follow. Another

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,910
important function of the life cycle model is to determine

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,290
the transition criteria between activities. So, when we can go from

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,000
one phase to the subsequent one. In other words, what

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,840
the model should describe is what should we do next and

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,450
how long should we continue to do it for each activity

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,290
in the model. Now lets see a few traditional software process

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,920
models. I will discuss them here at the high level and

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,000
then revisit some of these models in the different mini courses.
