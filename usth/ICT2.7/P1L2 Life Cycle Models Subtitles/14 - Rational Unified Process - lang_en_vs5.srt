00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,969
There are two more software process models that I want to cover, so

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,120
bear with me. The first one is the Rational Unified software Process

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,500
or IUP, which is s a very popular one based on UML.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,620
RUP works in an iterative way, which means it that it performs different

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,360
iterations. And at each iteration, it performs four phases. So what I'm

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,030
showing you here, is a high level view of the process. And I

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,630
don't want you to focus on all the different details, because we

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,170
will discuss these details later on, in a lesson that is actually dedicated

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,470
to RUP. What I want to give you now, is just the

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,020
gist of how this works. So, in each one of these four

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,680
phases, which I'm going to describe in a second. We perform standard software

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,060
engineering activities, the ones that we just discussed. And we do them

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,320
to different extent, based on the phase in which we are.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,841
In particular, in the inception phase the work is mostly to sculpt

15
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:47,940
the system. So basically figuring out what is the scope of the

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,220
work, what is the scope of the project, what is the domain.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,670
So that we can be able to perform initial cost

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,190
and budget estimates. The operational phase is the phase in which

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,910
we focus on the domain analysis and define the basic architecture

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,030
for the system. So this is a phase in which analysis

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,290
and design are particularly paramount. Then there is a construction phase,

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,250
which is where the bulk of the development actually occurs. And

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,640
as you can see here, is where most of the implementation

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,280
happens. And finally, the transition phase is the phase in which

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,090
the system goes from development into production, so that

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,380
it becomes available to users. And of course, this is

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,480
the phase in which the other activities in software

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,710
development become less relevant and deployment becomes the main one.
