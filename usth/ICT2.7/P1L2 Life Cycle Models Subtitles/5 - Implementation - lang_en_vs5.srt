00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,719
After we have designed our system we can implement

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,900
it. In the implementation phase what we do is basically

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,410
taking care of realizing the design of the system

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,920
that we just created and create an actual software system.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,530
There are four fundamental principles, four pillars that can

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,470
affect the way in which software is constructed. The first

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,900
one is the reduction of complexity. This aims to build

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,160
software that is easier to understand and use. The second

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,400
pillar is the anticipation of diversity. Which takes into

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,720
account that software construction might change in various way over

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,220
time. That is that software evolves. In many cases,

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,270
it evolves in unexpected ways. And therefore, we have to

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,680
be able to anticipate some of these changes. The

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,390
third pillar is the structuring for validation. Also called design

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,550
for testability. And what this means is that we

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,760
want to build software so that it is easily testable

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,890
during the subsequent validation and verification activities. Finally, and

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,040
this is especially true within specific organizations and or

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,770
domains. It is important that the software conforms to

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,330
a set of internal or external standards. And some examples

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,730
of this might be, for example, for internal standards,

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,680
coding standards within an organization, or naming standards within an

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,320
organization. As for external standards, if for example you

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,780
are developing some medical software. There are some regulations and

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,930
some standards that you have to adhere to in

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,060
order for your software to be valid in that domain.
