00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,900
Now let's discuss the next phase of software development,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,080
which is software design. Software design is the phase

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,030
where software requirements are analyzed in order to produce

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,500
a description of the internal structure and organization of

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,900
the system. And this description will serve as the

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,550
basis for the construction of the actual system. Traditionally,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,020
the software design phase consists of a series of

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,360
design activities. Which normally consists of the architectural design phase,

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,880
the abstract specification, interface design,

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,010
component design, data structure and

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,230
algorithm design. And notice that this is just a possible list

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,820
of activities. But you can also characterize design activities in

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,550
many different ways. And if you're looking at different books, and

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,800
different sources, you might find different activities described. But the

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,500
core idea, the important point is that we go from sort

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,940
of a high-level view of the system, which is the

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,770
architectural design, to a low-level view, which is the algorithm design.

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,100
And these activities result in a set of design

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,810
products, which describe various characteristics of the system. For

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,770
example, they describe the architecture of the system, so

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,890
how the system is decomposed and organized into components, the

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,630
interfaces between these components. They also describe these components

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,030
into a level of details that is suitable for

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,470
allowing their construction. We will discuss the details of

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,130
software design and talk extensively about these different actives and

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,200
these different products in the third mini course of this class.
