00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,750
As I just told you, tools are fundamental in

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,050
software engineering. And I will stress this concept over and

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,240
over, throughout the class. And today we're going to talk

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,310
about a tool that is especially important, which is integrated

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,060
development environments, or IDEs. And you're probably familiar with

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,060
IDEs. So IDEs are environments that give you support for

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,580
your development activities. For example, for writing code, editing code,

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,320
compiling code, and so on. And we will focus specifically

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,890
on one particular IDE, which is called Eclipse. And

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,450
what I'm showing here is the two splash screens for

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,350
two versions of eclipse, Helios and Kepler. Eclipse is an

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,200
open, extensible development environment that was initially created by IBM

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,510
and is now managed by the Eclipse Foundation. And of

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,840
course, there are many other great IDEs such as for

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,310
example, Microsoft Visual Studio or Netbeans. We will be using

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,830
Eclipse because it is open and because it is multi-platform,

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,390
which means that you can use Eclipse

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,140
no matter what operating system we're using.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,030
So if we consider the most commonly used operating system, such as Mac

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,780
OS, Windows, Linux, Eclipse runs on any

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,769
of these environments. Therefore, no matter what

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,490
you're using, you'll be able to install

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,560
Eclipse, run Eclipse, and follow the class.
