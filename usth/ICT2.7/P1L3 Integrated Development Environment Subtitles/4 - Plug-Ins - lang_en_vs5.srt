00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,134
In fact most IDEs are extensible through the use of

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:06,158
plug-ins. And by the way, note that plug-ins might be

3
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:09,326
called differently on different platforms. For example, if you're using

4
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:12,970
a Microsoft Visual Studio, plug-ins are normally called add-ins, but

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,598
the concept is more or less the same. So, what

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,555
is a plug-in? Well, let's imagine our IDE to be

7
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:22,320
this box. A plug-in is additional functionality that you can

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,430
actually plug into this box so that this box starts

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,830
offering more features to the user. For example, you

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,850
can add to Eclipse the Checkstyle plug-in. Which, paraphrasing the

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,950
Checkstyle website, helps you ensure that your Java code

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,890
complies with a set of coding standards by inspecting the

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,690
code and pointing out items that deviate from a

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,870
defined set of coding rules. Again, this is a functionality

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,330
the core of Eclipse doesn't have. You can add

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,600
the Checkstyle plug-in, and this functionality will become available in

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,840
the IDE. Another example of plug-in is the EGit plug-in which

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,660
adds support for the Git version control system in Eclipse. And

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,290
actually this is something that we'll cover in detail, we'll have

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,150
a demo, and we will actually use it throughout the class, so

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,018
I'm not going to say anything more about the EGit plug-in for

22
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,300
now. But again, what the plug-in will do is to add

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,220
the Git functionality to Eclipse. A functionality that is not in

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,110
the core of Eclipse and that is available to the user after

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,181
you add the plug-in.
