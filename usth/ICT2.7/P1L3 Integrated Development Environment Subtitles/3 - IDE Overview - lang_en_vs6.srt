00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,680
So, now let's look in a little more detail to what is an IDE. An IDE is a

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,790
software application that supports software developers in many of

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,840
their everyday tasks. It has many useful features. Most IDEs

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,790
provide views that can be used to navigate, project

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,140
resources from different perspectives. For example, you might want to

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,390
look at your code differently when you're writing code,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,950
and when you're debugging. They also normally provide an intelligent

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,380
source code editor. For example, an editor that will allow you

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,110
to browse the documentation when you're writing a code that

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,780
uses a specific method, or that will give you autocompletion when

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,990
you start writing the name of an object and you want to

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,820
get the methods for that object. And all of these things

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,420
can be very useful while you're developing and can save you a

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,750
lot of time. Modern IDE's will also normally give you support for

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,540
version control systems that then you

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,490
can use for softer configuration management.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,720
And we're going to discuss in detail version control systems in

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,380
the next tools of the trade lesson, and we're also

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,135
going to see how it can be integrated within an IDE.

20
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:04,730
IDEs also give you builders so they give you build automation

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,070
tools, they give you runtime support. So that you can

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,960
run your projects from within the IDE and, for example,

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,550
observe some aspects of the execution. In addition to giving

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,562
you support for the runtime, they give you support for testing.

25
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:21,267
Many IDEs allow you to run tests from within

26
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,520
the IDE and to check the results of the tests

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,300
from within the IDE. Not only that. Normally, after you

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,210
run your tests, if there are some test cases that

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,500
fail, you can also use your IDEs to do debugging.

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,620
Many IDEs include graphical debuggers. Debuggers will allow you to

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,400
navigate through the code, set which points, stop and restart

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,160
the execution. Inspect variables, and do all of the activities

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,320
that help debugging. And, to help you be more efficient

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,440
and more effective when you do debugging. And into addition to

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,760
all these features that are listed here IDEs can normally provide

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,650
you even more features through a mechanishm that is called plugins.
