1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,550
In the rest of this lesson we're going to look at eclipse and

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,290
try to get more familiar with eclipse in a hands on manner

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,550
through a demo. In the demo we will cover some of the

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,040
basic aspects of eclipse like how to run eclipse, how to select

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
their workspace, how to create a project, how to create the class

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
within the project and so on. I'll also cover some more advanced

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,610
aspects, like how to create builders, run your project within Eclipse, and

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,800
how to use their Eclipse debugger. So let's get to the demo.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,220
So let's start Eclipse. Eclipse is going to ask me

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,600
for the location of my workspace and in this

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,530
case, I selected a suitable directory and you can

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,480
also use that checkbox on the left to avoid Eclipse

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,640
for asking you again about where to put the

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,860
workspace. And the workspace is basically the place the

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,310
directory. Where, Eclipse will place all of your projects.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,830
So, now when you start Eclipse, if it's the first

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,480
time you might get this Welcome screen. It's not going to happen

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,500
again on subsequent executions, but I just wanted to make sure

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,210
that I covered all the bases. And so, whatcha want to

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,360
do here is to basically go to the java perspective

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
which you can do by clicking over there or you can

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,240
also use the menus. So in this case we will have

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,810
to go to Window, open Perspective, and if the Perspective is

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,660
not here, you'll have to click on Other. And at this point,

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,030
that you can click on Java Perspective, then you

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,680
click okay. And the perspective is basically, the visual work

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,810
space where you will be operating. So, after we selected

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,350
perspective, we can actually close the welcome screen. And here,

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,000
you see that you have this different areas and on

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,930
the left You have the package explorer. This is the

31
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,650
area where your packages will be, you've got a task list,

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,280
and an outline on the right which we'll cover later.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,870
And then you have underneath, the bottom, a problems, java

34
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,330
doc and declaration views and we will see some of

35
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,320
these views in actions later. And here in the center

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,290
you have the area. Which is called a code editor,

37
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,360
which is where you'll be writing, editing, and modifying, basically,

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,440
your code. This is where most of the action takes

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,140
place. So let's start by creating a Java project. And

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,950
to do that we can use either the context menu, or

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,560
you can just use the menu, select new Java project.

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,390
You'll be greeted by this, wizard, and. And at this

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,500
point in the wizard, you can select the name of

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,100
your project. I'm just going to call it a very simple way

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,990
my project. And I going to use the default location for

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,070
the project, as you can see it will be placed

47
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,440
in the work space that I selected before. I'm going to

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
also use the default. Java Runtime Environment, which is Java 1.7

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,250
in this case. I'm going to keep the selected default layout

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,120
and the, then I'm going to go to the next step. Here,

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,380
we're first presented with the location of the source code for

52
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,840
our project. The default is a directory SRC in my project

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,320
and for the output file, the directory bin. So repeat, we're now

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,410
going to change that. Here in case you need other projects to

55
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,240
build your own, then you can specify them here. Here we

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,570
are building a simple project, so there's no need for that.

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,890
And here we can specify which libraries our project requires. As

58
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,880
you can see, the Java library's already specified. And you can

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,840
also add other jars, which can even be External jars. And

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
finally this is the tab that allows you to specify which

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,300
part of you project. So how your project will be exported,

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,760
so lets not worry about that for now. Lets click finish.

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,300
And as you can see here on the package explorer, my

64
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,920
project appeared. So now we can open the project by clicking

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
on the triangle right next to it, and as you can

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,250
see there is the SRC directory, where my source code will go,

67
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,760
and there's also an indication that we're using the JRE, so that's

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,800
the Java system directory within our project. And this is just for people

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,860
who are interested in what happens you know, under the hood. So

70
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,840
if you don't care about that, you can just skip this part. So

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
basically here I'm showing you how we can go to the directory

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,250
where the project was created. We can see the bin and src directories.

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,020
And there's also some other files here that you can

74
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,780
see these 'dot' files that you will not normally, see. And

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,870
those are kind of bookkeeping files. So these are files that

76
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,280
contain information about your project and that are created automatically by

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,860
Eclipse. And, for example, will have various indication about the

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,580
configuration of the project, some settings and the class path for

79
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,880
the project. And, as I said, you don't have to worry

80
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,490
about this if you just want to go Eclipse as you're never

81
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,551
going to mess with the command line.
