Hi, and welcome to the first of several lessons on tools of the trade. I'm

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,200
very excited about these lessons, because I believe that tools are a cornerstone

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,390
of the software engineering discipline, and it

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,570
is of paramount importance to know and

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,330
use them. In this lesson, we will

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,530
talk about integrated development environments, normally called IDEs.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,780
And these are software applications that support developers in many of their

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,870
everyday tasks, such as writing, compiling, and debugging code. And to make the

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,470
discussion more concrete we will focus on a specific IDE, Eclipse. We will

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,250
first present Eclipse, and then get some hands-on experience through a demo.
