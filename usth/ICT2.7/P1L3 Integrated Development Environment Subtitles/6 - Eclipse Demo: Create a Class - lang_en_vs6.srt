1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,420
So now that we know, we saw what happens under

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,570
the hood, and as I said, don't worry about it if

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,689
you don't care about that part. Now we can go back

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,850
to Eclipse, and we can start creating a package. A package

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,125
is basically a way of organizing your classes into a

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:17,015
hierarchy. In this case, I'm going to specify the package name as

7
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:21,350
edu.gatech, which means that I'm creating really two packages, a package

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,480
gatech inside package edu. And I can start creating classes inside

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,770
my packages. So here, I can use the contextual menu, select

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,055
New&gt;Class, and I'll get another wizard that will allow me to

11
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,160
specify the name of the class. I'm not very creative here,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,250
so I'm just going to call it Hello World. There's many other parameters

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,710
you can set, and in particular, you can define whether you

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,450
want a main method in your class. Where having a main

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,460
method means that your class can be the main class in

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,850
your project, can be the one that is run when you run

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,340
your project. After we click the button, the Finish button, we,

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,859
we get the class. So we also get template code for the

19
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,604
class, as you can see here, so we go to the editor

20
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,120
function, you can see that there is a to do. Where you

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,019
have to put your code, and here we are simply, basically printing,

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,370
you know, the typical first program. We just going to print Hello World

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,180
in Java. And something you can note is that as we are

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,370
typing, Eclipse gives us a auto complete suggestions, which is very helpful.

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,650
For example, in case you don't remember the exact syntax,

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,190
or the method, or you don't remember the parameters of the

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,470
method. Which is, you know, often the case especially where you

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,590
work with large libraries. So having that feature can really, really

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,050
help you. So now if we want to run our code

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,380
we can either click on the button up here, or we

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,960
can right-click in the Call window and select Run As Java

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,370
Application. And if we do that, Eclipse will run our tool,

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,650
and it will create, as you can see here, a console view that basically contains

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,790
the textual output of my program. And as expected, the output is Hello World.
