1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,660
So now that we have run our program, let's see what

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,660
happens exactly when you run a program within Eclipse. And to

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,410
do that I'm going to use the menu over here which is

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,500
the Run menu and I'm going to select Run Configurations, and this

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,190
brings up a window where you can change or run configurations.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,200
Well first of all, you can see that here on the

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,260
left under Java application. Eclipse automatically created a Hello World run

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,300
configuration for our program. And this is where you can configure

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,370
the different parameters for your execution. For example,

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,520
you can select the main class. So here

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,745
it's, obviously, edu.gatech.HelloWorld. You can define different program

12
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,920
arguments. We don't have any for now. You can

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,480
also pass arguments to the virtual machine. You

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,960
can define which Java runtime environment you want to

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,720
use, Classpath and other environmental options. So let's

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,650
now try to pass some arguments to our program.

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,390
So for example here, I am just going to write George as

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,450
a possible parameter. I say Apply so that modify the configuration and

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,510
if i run the program of course, the output is not changing

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,440
because my program does not use the argument. But, let's see if

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
we do use the argument, what happens. So I'm going to slightly

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,030
modify the final program so that now, instead of printing hello

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,420
world, it will print hello followed by the first argument that I

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,700
will pass to the program. And if I do that, and I

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,420
go and I run the program, what I get is exactly what I

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,420
was expecting, which is Hello George. So this is the way in which you

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,120
can pass arguments to your execution, which

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,640
is something that might come in handy

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,390
for some other projects. When you need to run some code with an argument.
