1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,370
Now let's go back to the distinguishing aspects of

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,710
RUP, starting from the first one. That is, that the

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,170
rational unified process is use-case driven. So let's see what

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,310
that means. Generally speaking, we can see a system as

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,500
something that performs a sequence of actions in response to

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,100
user inputs. So the user submits some requests, or requests

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,140
some functionality, and the system responds to those requests. Use

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,750
cases, as we just said, capture exactly this interaction and

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,620
answer the question, what is the system supposed to do

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,150
for each user? So, this is a very important point.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,160
So they can represent what a system can do for

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,240
each of the different types of users of the system.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,430
For this reason, and as we will see in more

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,430
detail, in the rational unified process, use cases are a

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,680
central element of the whole development life cycle. From requirements

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,360
engineering, all the way through the process until testing and maintenance.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,620
So, once more, use cases are used to support and

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,162
help each one of these phases in the rational unified process.
