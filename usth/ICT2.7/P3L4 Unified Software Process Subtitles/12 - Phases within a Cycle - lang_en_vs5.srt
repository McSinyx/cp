1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,505
Now let's go back to the phases within a cycle.

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:04,930
because I want to show you how they relate to traditional

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,196
activities of software development. Because this is the first time that

4
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:12,066
we talk about inception, elaboration, construction and transition. So we will

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,859
know what they mean, in terms of the traditional software

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:18,380
development. So I'm going to first discuss these relations and then

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,198
I'm going to talk about each individual phase in further detail.

8
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:25,570
So I'm going to start by representing the four RUP phases here

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,810
with possible internal iterations. I1, E1 and E2, C1,

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,490
C2, and so on. And just as a reference, this

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,670
is the way in which time will progress. So we

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,890
will start with inception and we will finish with transition.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,710
So what I'm want to do now is to show the

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,930
actual, traditional, software development activities here on the left. And

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,970
I also want to show you, using this diagram, how these

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,610
activities are actually performed in each of the RUP phases.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,540
So, let's see what this representation means. Basically, what

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm showing here, is that requirements engineering actually starts in

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,480
the inception phase. So, you can see the height

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,090
of this bar as the amount of effort devoted to

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,890
this activity in this specific phase. So you can

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,950
see that requirements engineering starts in inception phase, is mostly

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,210
performed in the elaboration phase, and then it continues,

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,820
although to a lesser extent, throughout all phases up until

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,570
the end of the transition. But the bulk is really

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,940
performed here in the elaboration phase. Similarly, if we consider analysis

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,450
and design, we can see that analysis and design are

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,510
mainly performed in the elaboration phase. But a considerable amount of

29
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,900
it also continues in the construction phase, and then it

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,514
kind of phases out. So there's very little of that done

31
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:37,300
in the transition phase. Looking now at implementation, you can see

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,190
that the implementation happens mostly in the construction phase, which is,

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,460
unsurprisingly, the phase that is mostly concerned with actual code development,

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,620
as we will see in a minute. Testing, on the other

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,990
hand, is performed throughout most phases, with, peaks in some specific

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,260
point, for example, at the end of some iterations, like here

37
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,880
and here. To conclude, we have the business modeling activity that

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,160
happens mainly in the inception and a little bit in the

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,100
elaboration phase and the deployment activity which happens a little bit

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,420
throughout, but the bulk of it is really in the transition

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,699
phase, which is actually the phase that has to do

42
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,070
with deployment and then maintenance. So I hope this kind

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,970
of high level view gives you a better understanding of

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,940
what is the mapping between these new phases and, the

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,760
typical software development activities that we are more familiar with.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,360
So to further this understanding, later in the lesson, I'm

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,220
also going to talk about these specific phases individually. First, however,

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,610
I want to spend a little more time discussing what happens

49
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,200
inside each one of these iterations, just to make sure

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,410
that we are all understand what an iteration is exactly.
