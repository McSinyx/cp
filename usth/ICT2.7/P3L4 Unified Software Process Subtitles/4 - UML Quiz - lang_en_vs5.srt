00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,440
Before doing that though, let's have a quiz to check whether you remember

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,160
the basics of UML. Since we're going to talk about use cases, I want

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,040
to ask you, what is the difference between a use case and a

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,330
use case model. So here are the possible answers, and you can mark

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,710
more than one. First one is that only use case models include actors.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,150
The second is that they are the same thing. The third one is

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,000
that a use case model is a set of use cases. The fourth

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950
one says that a use case is a set of use case models.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,520
Finally, the last one says that use cases

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,650
are a dynamic representation, whereas use case models

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,880
are a static representation of a system. So

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,810
mark all the answers that you think are correct.
