00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:02,850
So now, since we're talking about the incremental and iterative

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,950
nature of the Rational Unified Process, let's have a quiz on

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,460
the benefits of iterative approaches. So I'd like for you to tell

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,710
me what are these benefits. Is one benefit the fact that

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,129
iterative approaches keep developers busy or maybe that they give developers

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,480
early feedback, that they allow for doing the same thing over

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,930
and over in an iterative way. Maybe they also minimize the

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,210
risk of developing the wrong system. Can they be used to

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,170
improve planning, or is it the benefit

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,160
that they accommodate evolving requirements. Also, in this

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,360
case, I would like for you to check all the answers that you think are correct.
