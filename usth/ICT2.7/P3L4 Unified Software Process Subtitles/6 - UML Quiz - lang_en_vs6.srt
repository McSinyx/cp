00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,650
So, since we are talking about use case diagrams, I also want

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,593
to ask you, what are use case diagrams used for? So, what

3
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,600
are they good for? Why are they useful within a software process?

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,130
Also in this case, I'm providing several possible answers. They are not really

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,420
used for anything. Or, they can be used to prioritize requirements. Or,

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,220
maybe they can be used for user interface design. They can be

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,280
used during requirements elicitation. They can

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,890
be used for code optimization. And

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,570
finally, they can be used for test case design. Also, in this case,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,650
I would like you to mark all the answers that you think are correct.
