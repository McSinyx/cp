1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's talk a little bit more about phases. The rational unified

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,050
process phases are fundamental aspects of this process and which just touched

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,200
on them so we just give a quick overview. And I want to

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,010
look at these phases in a little more detail. So, what I'm

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,960
going to do is, for each phase, I'm going to discuss what it is,

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,310
what it produces and how is the result of the phase suppose

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,910
to be,. Assessed, and what are the consequences of this assessment. So

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,350
let's start with the first phase, the inception phase. The first phase

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,920
goes from the idea of the product to the

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,990
vision of the end product. What this involves is basically

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,230
to delimiting the project scope. And making the business case

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,040
for the product presented. Why is it worth doing? What

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,870
are the success criteria? What are the main risks? What

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,690
resources will be needed? And so on, specifically these phases

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,310
answer three main questions. The first one is, what are

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,330
the major users or actors, to use the UML terminology.

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,450
And what will the system do for them? To

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,780
answer this, these phases produce a simplified use-case model where

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,480
only a few use-cases are represented and described. So this

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,390
is a sort of initial use-case model. The second question

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,610
is about the architecture, what could be an architecture

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,370
for the system? So in this phase we will normally

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,420
also develop a tentative architecture. So an initial architecture that

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,540
describes the most crucial subsystems. Finally this phase also answers

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,890
the question, what is the plan and how much

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,620
will it cost? To answer this question. This phase will

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,930
identify the main risks for the project and also produce

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,600
a rough plan with estimates for resources, initial planning for

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,820
the phases and dates and milestones. Specifically, the inception phase

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,370
generates several deliverables. It is very important that you pay

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,600
attention so that you understand what this deliberate approach are.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
Starting from the first one, which is the vision document.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,800
And this is a document that provides a general

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,420
vision of the core projects requirements, key features and main

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,890
constraints. Together with this, the inception phase also produces an

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,900
initial use case model, as I just mentioned. So this

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,720
is a use case model that includes an initial set

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,670
of use cases, and then will be later refined. Two

39
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,300
additional variables are the initial project glossary, which describes the

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,330
main terms, using the project and their meaning, and the

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,229
initial business case which includes business context. And

42
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,470
success criteria. Yet another deliverable for the inception phase

43
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,770
is the initial project plan, which shows the

44
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,650
phases, iterations, roles of the participants, schedule and initial

45
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,610
estimates. In addition, the inception phase also produces

46
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,810
a risk assessment document, which describes the main risks

47
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,970
and counters measures for this risk. Finally, and this

48
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,430
is an optional deliverable, in the sense that it,

49
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,990
it might or might not be produced, depending on the specific

50
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,870
project. As part of the inception phase we might also generate

51
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,780
1 or more prototypes. For example, we might develop prototypes to

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,590
address some specific risks that we have identified or to show some

53
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,380
specific aspect of the system of which we are unsure to

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,910
the stakeholders. So basically all the typical users of prototypes that

55
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,600
we discussed before. So when we're done with the inception phase

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,300
we hit the first milestone for the cycle we are currently performing.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,600
And so there are some evaluation criteria that will tell

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,640
us whether we can consider the inception phase concluded or not.

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,840
And the first of this criteria is stakeholder concurrence, which

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,510
means that all the stakeholders must agree on the scope, definition,

61
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,510
and cost schedule estimates for the projects. The second criteria

62
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,040
needs requirements understanding, out of the initial primary use cases that

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,380
we have identified so far, the right one for our system.

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,760
And other criteria is the credibility of the cost schedule estimates,

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,280
the priorities, defined the risks identifies and the countermeasures for

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,590
those risks, and the development process that we're following. Finally, in

67
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,000
the case we produce prototypes as part of the inceptional

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,520
phase, this will also be evaluated and assessed to judge the

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,960
overall outcome of the phase. So what happens if the

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,170
project fails to pass this milestone? So if the outcome of

71
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,020
the inception phase is considered to be inadequate with respect

72
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,642
to one or more of these criteria. Well at this point,

73
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:51,240
since we're kind of an initial phase of the cycle

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,370
the project may be cancelled or considerably re-thought. So to

75
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,610
summarize all of these in one sentence the Inception Phase

76
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,320
is the phase in which we produce. Then you shall vision,

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,750
used case model, project plan, risk assessment and possibly, prototypes

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,290
for the project. And we have to make sure, that

79
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,680
all of this deliverables satisfy a set of criteria, so

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,770
that we can continue on the project. And otherwise, we'll either

81
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,160
cancel the project or rethink its scope, or other aspects of it.
