1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,520
So what happens, exactly, within an iteration? In

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,680
almost every iteration, developers perform the following activities.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,830
So they identify which pieces of functionality this

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,450
iteration will develop, will implement. After doing that, they

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,240
will create a design, for the considered use

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,640
cases, and they will do that guided by the

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,334
chosen architecture. So the set of use cases

8
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:25,666
plus the architectural guidelines will result in a design

9
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,035
for the selected use cases. Once the design is defined,

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,060
then the developers will implement the design, which will result

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,430
in a set of software components. They will then verify

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,992
the components against the use cases to make sure that the

13
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:41,740
components satisfy the use cases, they suitably realize the use

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,995
cases. And they will do that through testing or some

15
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:47,730
other verification and validation activity. Finally, after verifying that the

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,320
code actually implements the use cases, they will release a product,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,840
which also represent the end of the iteration. And notice that

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,370
what I put here is an icon for the world,

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,330
in double quotes. Because in many cases the release will be

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,050
just an internal release or maybe a release that will just

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,813
go to some of the stakeholders so that they can provide

22
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,040
feedback on that. Okay. So it doesn't have to be an

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,080
external release. It doesn't have to be a release to the

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,270
world. But it is, nevertheless, a release of a software product. .
