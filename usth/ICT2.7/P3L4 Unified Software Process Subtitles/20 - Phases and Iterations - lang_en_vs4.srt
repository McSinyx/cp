00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,210
So now I would like to wrap up this lesson

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,720
by going back to our discussion of rational unified process

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,630
phases and iterations. So to do that I'm going to bring

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,480
back the presentation that I used before, the summary representation

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,840
about phases and traditional software engineering activities. And I want to

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,720
use this representation to stress and discuss a couple of

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,140
things. Mainly I want to recap it because I think

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,480
it is very important. What is the relation between the rational

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,270
unified process, and the traditional software engineering phases, and software

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,540
engineering activities? And I like to do it now that

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,648
we have discussed the phases in a little more detail.

12
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,920
So I want to make sure that it is clear by now

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,660
how and when the traditional software engineering activities, the ones

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,620
listed here, take place in the context of the RUP

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,850
phases, the four listed up here. For instance, it should

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,410
be clear why implementation takes place mainly in the construction phase.

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,140
Why requirements engineering is prominent in the elaboration phase

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,290
and why deployment activities occur mostly in the transition phase,

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,120
and so on. So it should be clear now

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,930
why the activities are so distributed in the four phases.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,130
It should also be clear that although there is

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,350
normally one main phase for each activity, the activities really

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,550
span multiple phases. Which is actually one of the interesting

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,580
aspect of RUP. So the fact that you're not really

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,700
done with an activity even in later phases. Why? Well, because that allows

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,070
you, in subsequent iterations, to address

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,370
problems that came up in previous iterations.
