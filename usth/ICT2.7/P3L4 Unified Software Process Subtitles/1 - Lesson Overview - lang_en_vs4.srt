In the previous lessons of this mini-course,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,620
we discussed high level design, or architecture,

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,380
low level design, and design patterns. Now, we're going to see how we can put

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,380
this and also others software engineering activities

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,436
together in the context of a UML-based

6
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,820
process model, the unified software process, or

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,580
USP. We will discuss how USP was defined,

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,492
its main characteristics, its phases, and how we can apply it in practice.
