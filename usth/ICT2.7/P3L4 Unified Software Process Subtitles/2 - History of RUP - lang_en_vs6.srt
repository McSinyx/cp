00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,252
As I just said, today we're going to talk about the

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,876
Rational Unified Process. And you know that I like to provide

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:07,632
the historical perspective of the topics that we cover in class

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,070
and this lesson is no exception. So let's see a little bit

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,500
of history of RUP. To do that we have to go

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,620
back to 1997 when Rational defined six best practices for modern software

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,930
engineering. So let's look at what these practices were. The first

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,330
practice involved developing in an iterative way with risk as the primary

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,700
iteration driver. The second practice had to do

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,375
with managing requirements, including updating them and keeping

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,570
traceability information between requirements and other software

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,675
artifacts. Practice number three was to employ a

13
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,830
component-based architecture. What that means is to have

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,540
a high level design that focuses on cooperating

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,780
components that are nevertheless very cohesive and highly

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,710
decoupled. Modeling software visually is another key aspect

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,250
of the rational unified process. And the key concept

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,070
here is to use visual diagrams, and in particular UML

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,520
visual diagrams, in a very extensive way so as

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,950
to make artifacts easier to understand and agree upon among

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,849
stakeholders. And the fact that the process is defined

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,510
in an iterative way, allows for performing quality assurance activities

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,430
in a continuous way. So it allows for continuously

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,860
verifying quality throughout the development

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,220
process. Finally, change management and

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,750
control were also at the center of the rational

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,100
approach These six practices, that I just mentioned were

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,740
the starting point for the development of the Rational

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,300
Unified Process, which is what we're going to discuss next.
