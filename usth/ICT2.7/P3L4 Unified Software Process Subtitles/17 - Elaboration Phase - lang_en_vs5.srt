1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,400
Now that we've discussed the inception phase, let's move

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,180
on to the second phase of RUP, which is

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,280
the elaboration phase. And there are four main goals

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,900
and activities for the elaboration phase. Analyzing the problem domain

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,690
to get a better understanding of the domain. Establishing

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,840
a solid architectural foundation for the project. Eliminating the highest

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,454
risk elements which basically means addressing the most critical

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,590
use cases. And finally, refine the plan of activities and estimates

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,250
of resources to complete the project. The outcome

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,310
of the elaboration phase reflects these activities and also

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,440
in this case produces several artifacts. The first one

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,700
is an almost complete use case model with all use cases

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,560
and actors identified and most use case descriptions developed.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,070
As part of this phase we also identify a

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,550
set of what we called supplementary requirements. So these

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,685
are basically all the requirements that are not associated

17
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:53,483
with a use case. And these sets includes in particular all

18
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,110
non-functional requirements such as security,

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,630
reliability, maintainability and so on. So

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,770
all the ones that are relevant for the system that

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,280
you're developing. We mentioned before

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,410
that the software architecture is developed

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,220
in an incremental way, so it's not created at once.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,650
And this is exactly what happens in the elaboration phase, that

25
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,990
we take the initial architecture that was defined in the inception

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,280
phase and we refine it until we get to a software

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,400
architecture which is complete. And that is part of the

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,410
deliverables for this phase. And the list continues, so let

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,020
me make some room. In addition to producing a complete

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,270
architecture for our system, in the elaboration phase we also

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,130
define the lower-level design for the system. And, therefore, as

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,560
part of this phase, we produce as deliverables a design

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,000
model, and together with that, a complete set of test

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,770
cases, and an executable prototype. We also produce a revised

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,390
project plan. Now that we have more information about the

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,120
project we can refine the various estimates and the various

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,020
pieces of information in the project plan. And also an

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,160
updated risk assessment document. Finally, in this phase we also generate

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,680
a preliminary user manual that describes to the users how

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,350
the system can be used and should be used. So now

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,630
let's see what are the evaluation criteria for the elaboration

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,880
phase which is our second milestone. So I'm just going to list

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,400
them here. The first one is whether the vision

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,620
and the architecture are stable or they're still changing so

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,680
did we converge into a final complete vision for the

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,620
system? Does the prototype show that the major risks that

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,090
we have identified have been resolved or at least addressed

48
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,390
in this phase? Is the project plan sufficiently detailed and

49
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,030
accurate? Do all stakeholders agree that the vision can be

50
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,320
achieved with the current plan? Is the actual resource expenditure

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,840
versus the planned expenditure acceptable? So now we study consumer

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
resources and therefore we can check whether our estimates were

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,964
correct. And also in this case the project might be

54
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:45,730
cancelled or considerably reshaped if it fails to pass this milestone.
