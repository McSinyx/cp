1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,754
All the testing levels that we've seen so far is what

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:06,058
we can call developer's testing. So that's testing that is performed

3
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:09,649
either within the testing organization, or by somebody who's doing like

4
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:13,520
third-party testers on behalf of the testing organization. But there are two

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,280
other kinds of testing that are worth mentioning that are also

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,600
related to testing phases and these are alpha and beta testing.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,050
Alpha testing is the testing performed by distributing a software system

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,000
ready to be released to a set of users that are internal

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,480
to the organization that developed the software. So you can consider these

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,460
users as, if you pass me the term, guinea pigs that will

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,170
use an early version of the code and will likely discover errors

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,850
that escaped testing and will have made it to the field if

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,390
not caught. Beta testing is the next step after alpha testing, in

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,530
which the software is released to a selected subset of users, in

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,770
this case, outside your organization. And also in this case, the users

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,110
are likely to discover latent errors in the code before it is officially

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,240
released to the broader user population, so before we have an

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,850
actual product release. So you may wonder why do we need

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,360
to do both alpha and beta testing. Why not just one

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,980
of the two? The reason is that alpha testing is performed

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,730
to iron out the very obvious issues that still escape testing,

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,610
but we want to do that before involving people outside your

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,730
organization. And the rationale is that alpha testers have a higher

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,710
tolerance for problems than beta testers, who expect a mostly working system.
