1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,690
So now, let me ask you a second question. We just saw that we

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,640
can, reveal a failure in the program

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
by calling double with parameter three. Where

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,750
is the fault that causes such failure in the program? So I want you

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,900
to write the number of the line of code that, that contains the fault.
