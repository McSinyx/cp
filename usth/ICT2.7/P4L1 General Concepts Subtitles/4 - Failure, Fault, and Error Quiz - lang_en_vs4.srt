00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,900
So now I have a few questions for you. And so we use, as

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,350
usual, our developer Janet to introduce a quiz. And the first question I want to

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,710
ask you is the following. A call to double passing three as a parameter returns

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,149
the value nine. What is this? Is that a failure, a fault, or an error?
