1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,570
So let's have another simple quiz, and we're going to

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,490
have our developer Brett introducing the quiz. And the

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,900
starting point for this quiz is the fact that

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,970
today, quality assurance, or verification, if you wish, is mostly

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,730
testing. That is, testing is the most commonly used

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,550
activity to perform software verification. So now, I'm going to show

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,310
you a quote, 50% of my company employees are

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,691
testers and the rest spends 50% of their time testing,

9
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,347
so I want to ask you, who said

10
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:29,664
that? I'm going to give you some possibilities. Was

11
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:34,215
that Yogi Berra, Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, Bill

12
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:37,360
Gates or Frank Gehry? Take your best guess.
