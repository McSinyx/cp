00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,614
The fact that the call to double three returns nine instead of six is clearly

2
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:13,000
a failure because it is an observable incorrect behavior of the program.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,110
So let me remind you that the failure is conceptually related to the

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,076
behavior of the program, to the way the program acts and not its code.
