00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,090
So, I want to ask you one last question about

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,480
this problem. What is the error that cause the fault

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,180
at line three? Remember that an error is the

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,010
cause of a fault and it's usually a human error.
