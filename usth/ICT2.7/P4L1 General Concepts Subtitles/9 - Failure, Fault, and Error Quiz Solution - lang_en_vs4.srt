00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,740
And I apologize, but this was a tricky question that

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,770
we cannot really answer. We really have no way to

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,860
know what the error was. It could have been a

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,240
typo, an erroneous copy and paste operation, or even worse

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,079
a conceptual error. In case a developer did not know

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,910
what it means to double a number. Unfortunately though, the

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,200
developer is the only one who could actually answer this

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,610
question. So even though we cannot really answer this question,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,000
having it help us think about how the

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
error is in fact related to human behavior.
