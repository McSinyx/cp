00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,404
Before telling you what the right answer is, let

2
00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:04,240
me remind you that the fault is related to

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,508
the code, and is a necessary, but not sufficient

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:09,560
condition for the occurrence of a failure. So in this

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,450
case, a single faulty line is responsible for the

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,435
failure, which is line three. So the correct answer, is

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:20,700
three. At line three, the program computes i times

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,080
i, instead of i times 2, as it should do.
