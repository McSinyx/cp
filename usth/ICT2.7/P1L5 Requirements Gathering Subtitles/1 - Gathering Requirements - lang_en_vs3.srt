Gathering requirements is one of the most difficult tasks a software

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,010
engineer faces. In industry, you may gather requirements from end users,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,580
external clients, or from co-workers in other areas of your own

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,320
company. Occasionally, you may receive a well documented set of requirements.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,970
However, in most cases, you will need to glean the requirements

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,230
from conversations with the prospective clients, and distill them down into

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,150
something actionable on your own. Suppose a teacher came to you

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,310
with a request for a piece of software their students could

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,500
use to find out the average length of the sentences in

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,390
their essays. What questions come into mind to help you figure

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,620
out the full requirements for this project. Write down a list

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,630
of at least ten questions that might help you determine them.

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,240
Please take the time to do this before moving on. There's

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,670
no penalty for looking ahead, but if you skip this exercise

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,920
you'll cheat yourself out of the benefits of brainstorming and getting

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,190
your mind around the project before being bombarded by more information.
