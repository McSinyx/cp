Hi, I'm Lauren.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,990
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Alvin.

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,470
&gt;&gt; I'm an instructor at a university nearby and I've been noticing that when

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,700
my students write their essays, they have

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,100
very long, very wordy sentences and I would

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,600
like to develop some kind of tool that they can use to keep track of

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,440
this and maybe perfect their writing style.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,410
Do you think that's something you could do?

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,850
&gt;&gt; I think so. Let's start by helping me get acquainted with the students

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,620
in the class. So how many students do we have in this class typically?

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,000
&gt;&gt; Usually about 45 per unit, but I can have up to six units a semester.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,420
&gt;&gt; 45 students, and six sections per

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,220
semester. That's a farily reasonable size. So,

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,790
do you know anything about what the students are using as far as computers go?

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,640
&gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of computers they're using. And they

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,960
could be, I don't know, anywhere from having no tech experience to

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,200
being pretty proficient.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,930
&gt;&gt; Do you know anything about how

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,350
familiar the students are with computers in general?

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,540
&gt;&gt; I'm sure we have some people on the low end that have

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,430
never done any type of programming, and

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,680
then some people who are pretty self-sufficient.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,210
&gt;&gt; Okay, and I guess my last question related to

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,170
the students is, what is the students actually submitting to you.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,080
&gt;&gt; They've been sending just raw text files via email to me.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,660
&gt;&gt; So from the sounds of things

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,140
we have a fairly broad, I guess base

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,100
of students to work with, both in technical proficiency

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,180
as well as their operating system environments potentially.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,420
So I think what we'll probably do to start

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,270
off with is make a command line, Java

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,760
based tool. That the students can run and we'll

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,910
give them a fair amount of you know, documentation

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,690
on how to use the tool. And I expect

35
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,090
that there will be a lot of little error conditions that may happen

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,320
that we want to produce a reasonably friendly message were anything to go wrong.

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That'd be great.

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,750
&gt;&gt; So, a little bit more, I guess about

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,539
the actual essay itself, its submission, what constitutes a word?

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,190
&gt;&gt; I really only care about the longer words, so, is there a

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,140
way that we can only count words that are maybe above three letters?

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,830
&gt;&gt; I think

43
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,508
that's something we can do. And I think

44
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,030
that because you seem a little bit unsure

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,540
we might be able to have that be

46
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,820
a little bit more flexible than we otherwise would.

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,500
&gt;&gt; Great.

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,330
&gt;&gt; What does a sentence mean to you? Is it kind of flexible?

49
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,280
&gt;&gt; I would say anything that ends in a period or

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,870
even a question mark. Maybe even an exclamation mark. or, something

51
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,760
even, maybe even with a comma or semi-colon. I really only

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,370
care about the sentences that aren't gramatically correct and are too long.

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,180
&gt;&gt; I think we can probably make that a little bit more flexible too

54
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,520
so that way, you can kind of say we're going to, or you want to include them.

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,020
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

56
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,786
&gt;&gt; So maybe, sounds like you are little bit on the fence

57
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,100
about whether or not say, a comma should be considered a sentence.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,130
&gt;&gt; Mm.

59
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,370
&gt;&gt; Entirely on its own or not. So we

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,830
can probably make that a little bit configurable as well.

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,510
And so, just to confirm the actual end result to

62
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,870
the student is the average number of words per sentence?

63
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that'd be fine.

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,430
&gt;&gt; Okay, overall to start off with, looks like we have some

65
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,280
sort of customization of the word length that we want to look for.

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,780
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Yeah.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,650
&gt;&gt; We have some kind of variability in

68
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,880
what we want to have as acceptable sentence structure.

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,570
So, periods, question marks, semicolons, things like that. And, the end result

70
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,260
to the student is if we're successful, they'll get the average number of

71
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,060
words per sentence. Otherwise we tell them something a little bit helpful to

72
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,240
kind of put them on the right track to use the tool correctly.

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,620
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's the error codes right?

74
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,150
&gt;&gt; Hopefully not error codes but something a little bit nicer.

75
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,800
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,150
&gt;&gt; So I think I have enough to

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,440
get started and produce something that's you know,

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,150
a reasonable I guess, rough draft. Of something

79
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,700
that you can use to help your class out.

80
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,590
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you.

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
