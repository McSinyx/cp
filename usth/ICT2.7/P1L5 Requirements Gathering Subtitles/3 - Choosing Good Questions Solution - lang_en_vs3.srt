1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,260
The last question is almost never a reasonable one. For one

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,660
thing, the client should not need to know or care about

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,412
how many lines of code make up the program's source code.

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:09,910
In forming requirements, you should avoid

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,940
implementation specific questions that do not

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,290
directly interface with the user. The first question is very relevant

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,830
in some situations. For example, a graphic sentence with video game or

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,630
performance is key. However, you should not write any operating system

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,620
specific code unless absolutely needed, and should strive to make your code

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,070
platform independent whenever possible. The

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,990
second question, however, is very relevant.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,870
Now that you've thought a bit about what you might ask of

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,810
the client requesting this program, let's watch Alvin, one of Udasea's

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,850
engineers, asking his own questions. He'll be speaking with Lauren, the client.
