1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,680
Okay, let's start with the Android Operating System. The Android

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,170
system, heavily based on the generation and handling of events,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,640
so it is mostly an event driven system. However, it

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,870
also has some elements of publish, subscribe, in the way

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,480
elements in the system can register for elements of interest.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,570
So we can mark both styles here. So what about

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,449
Skype? We haven't discussed Skype yet. So here we probably

8
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,019
had to take a little bit of a wild guess.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,068
But as we will see in more detail in the

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,736
rest of the lesson. Skype is mainly a peer to

11
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:34,035
peer architecture, with some minimal elements of a client server

12
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,770
architecture. For example, when you start Skype and sign in

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,420
to a conceptually centralized server. So let's move to the

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,930
World Wide Web. As we just discussed, the Word Wide

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,255
Web is based on a rest architecture. And because rest

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:50,170
style, is a hybrid derived from other architectural styles, including the

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,960
client server architectural styles. Both of those styles apply here.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,465
And finally Dropbox is by and large, a client server

19
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:01,904
architecture. As conceptually, we upload our documents to a Dropbox

20
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:05,370
central server, and get the files from the same server.
