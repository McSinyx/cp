Hello, and welcome to the third part

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,426
of our software engineering course. In this mini-course,

3
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:09,250
we will discuss software design. We will

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,170
also introduce the Unified Software Process. And we

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,730
will work on a more complex project,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,330
in which we will develop a distributed software

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,960
system that involves multiple different platforms. In

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,730
our first lesson of this mini-course, in particular,

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,150
we will talk about software architecture. A

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,650
software engineering discipline whose goal is to lay

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,980
the foundation on which to build successful

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,130
and long lasting software systems. So let's begin.
