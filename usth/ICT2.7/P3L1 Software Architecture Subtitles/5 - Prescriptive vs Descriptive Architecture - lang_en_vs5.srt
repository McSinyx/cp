1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,200
We can look at the software architecture from two

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,120
main standpoints. There are prescriptive and descriptive software architectures.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,900
So what does that mean? A prescriptive architecture captures

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,620
the design decisions that are made prior to the

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,398
system's construction. This is what we normally call the

6
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:18,280
as-conceived software architecture. Conversely,

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,550
a descriptive architecture describes how

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,010
the system has actually been built. So it's based

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,860
on observing the system as it is and extracting

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,200
the architecture from the observation. This is what we call

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,890
the as-implemented software architecture. And one key point here is

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,780
that often, these two architectures, the prescriptive and the descriptive

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,290
architectures end up being different. So let's see why that happens.
