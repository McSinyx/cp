1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,100
A system cannot fulfill its purpose until it is

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,727
deployed. And deploying a system involves physically placing the

3
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:09,960
system's executable modules on the hardware devices on which

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,490
they are supposed to run. So when you do that,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,132
you're basically mapping your components and connectors to specific

6
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:19,810
hardware elements. Here in this diagram, for instance, I'm

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,160
showing the same components that we saw in the

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,400
previous diagram, but we see them deployed on a laptop,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,620
which is depicted here in this way, and on two

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,820
smartphones that are represented here, or PDAs, if you wish.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,730
So why do we this, why do we create

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,540
a deployment perspective for our architecture? Well, because the deployment

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,710
view of an architecture can be critical in assessing whether

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,920
the system will be able to satisfy its requirement. Because

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,860
doing this mapping allows you to discover and assess other

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,840
characteristics of your system that you might not have considered

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,440
up to now. For instance, using a deployment view like this

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,030
one and knowing the characteristics of the hardware devices, one might

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,056
be able to assess the system in terms of available memory.

20
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,610
Is there going to be enough memory available to run the system,

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,140
for example, on this device? Power consumption. Is the power consumption

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,270
profile going to be larger than what the device can handle?

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,580
Or again the required network bandwidth. Does the system have enough

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,170
network bandwidth to enable the required interactions? And so on. So all

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,140
of these characteristics, all of these qualities, you can assess when

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,730
you do this final mapping of the components to the hardware elements.
