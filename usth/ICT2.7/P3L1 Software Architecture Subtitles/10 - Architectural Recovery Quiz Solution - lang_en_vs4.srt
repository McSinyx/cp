1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,210
The first sentence is definitely false. Prescriptive architecture

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,530
and descriptive architecture tend to diverge as systems evolve,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,960
and sometimes, even when the system is first developed,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,680
as we will see in some of the upcoming

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,340
examples. Conversely, the second sentence is true. By

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,150
adding unnecessary elements to the architecture, architectural drift can

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,470
transform an otherwise clean architecture into a complex sub-optimal,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,960
and often ugly, architecture. The third sentence is false.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,540
Architectural erosion and architectural drift are, indeed, different phenomena.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,940
But they both result in a less than ideal, and

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,160
in some cases, highly degraded architecture. And the fourth

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,600
sentence is also false, as we discussed a minute ago.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,050
Just tweaking at the code is very unlikely to

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,930
improve the code. Quite the opposite, actually. The best way

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,420
to repair a degraded architectural design is to first, understand

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,110
the current architecture, and then, try to fix it in

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,280
a more principled way.
