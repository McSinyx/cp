00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,770
Now that we have discussed a few foundational aspects

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,410
of software architectures, and we have looked at some real

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,900
world examples that help us to illustrate some of these

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,560
points, to discuss some of these aspects. I want to

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,730
introduce and define the different elements that compose a software

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,700
architecture and also talk about architectural styles. So let's start

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,190
by discussing a software architecture's

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,880
elements. A software system's architecture

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,690
typically is not, and should not be, a uniform monolith.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,770
On the contrary, an architecture should be a

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,910
composition and interplay of different elements. In particular,

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,510
as we quickly mentioned at the beginning of

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,970
the lesson, there are three main types of elements

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,160
in an architecture. Processing elements, data elements, and

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,580
interaction elements. Processing elements are those elements that implement

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,260
the business logic and perform transformations on data.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,760
Data elements, also called information or state, are those

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,180
elements that contain the information that is used

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,440
and transformed by the processing elements. And finally,

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,030
the interaction elements are the glue that holds

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,760
the different pieces of the architecture together. Now,

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,030
the processing elements and the data are contained

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,350
into the system components, whereas the interaction elements

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,900
are maintained and controlled by the system connectors.

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,100
And components and connectors get all cooked together

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,980
into a systems configuration, which models

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,940
components, connectors and their relationships. So

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,850
now, let's look at components, connectors

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,770
and configurations in a little more detail.
