Now that we discussed some important concepts about

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,060
software architectures, I would like for you to

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,290
tell me which of the following sentences is

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,420
true. Prescriptive architecture and descriptive architecture are typically the

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,970
same. Architectural drift results in unnecessarily complex architectures.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,320
Architectural erosion is less problematic than architectural drift. And

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,660
the best way to improve a degraded architecture,

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,250
is to keep fixing the code until the system

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,270
starts looking and behaving as expected. Which of these sentences is true?
