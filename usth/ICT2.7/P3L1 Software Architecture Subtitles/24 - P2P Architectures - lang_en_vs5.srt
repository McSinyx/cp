00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,110
We're not going to be able to study indepth

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,590
any of the architectural styles that we just discussed. However, I

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,790
want to at least discuss two representative examples of P2P

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,100
architectures. Because, these are systems that you probably used, or at

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,090
least, you used one of them. And, they will allow

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,590
me to highlight some interesting points. So, as we just mentioned,

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,450
P2P systems are decentralized resource sharing and discovery systems. And the

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,370
two systems that I want to discuss, and that are representative

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,630
of this kind of architectures, are Napster and Skype. And you may or

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,920
may not be familiar with Napster, but I'm pretty sure that you know Skype.
