00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,630
Consider now the following architectural styles

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,356
that we just saw: pipes and filters,

3
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:09,310
event-driven, publish-subscribe, client-server, peer-to-peer, and rest.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,150
I'm showing you here, a list of

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,220
four different systems, and I would like for you to mark here which

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,750
architectural style, or styles, characterize Each of

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,510
these systems. Again, mark all that apply.
