00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,880
What I'm showing here is what an architectural configuration of

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
a system might look like in practice. And as you

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,560
can see, the configuration includes a set of components, which

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,200
are these rectangles over here. The components have various kinds of

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,460
ports, which are the ones marked here on the components

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,760
with different graphical representations. And

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
the components communicate through various

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,860
types of connectors, which are the grey elements here which

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,570
as you can see are used to connect the different components.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,180
And something else that you can notice by looking at

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,720
this configuration is the fact that you can also have

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,980
hierarchically decomposable components. For example, if you look at the strategy

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,250
analyzer component, you can see that it has three subcomponents: one,

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,110
two, and three and two internal connectors as part of

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,832
it. And it is worth recalling here that a component

16
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,152
diagram as we said when first discussed in UML in

17
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:51,230
the course, can also be used to represent an architectural configuration.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,920
So sometimes you will see architectural

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,250
configurations represented as UML component diagrams.
