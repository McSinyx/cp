1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,330
At this point, we have seen some examples of

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,070
things that might go wrong with the software architecture. So

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,220
I'd like to ask you also to recap some of

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,800
the concepts that we've touched upon. What are ideal characteristics

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,526
of an architectural design? And I'm showing you three possibilities

6
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:16,970
here: scalability, low cohesion, and low coupling. And some of

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,260
these concepts we did not explicitly define, but we talked

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,400
about it when discussing the examples that we just saw.
