1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
And there are two important and related concepts that

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,790
have to do with the way software architecture

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,109
evolves. The first one is Architectural Drift, which is

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,140
the introduction of architectural design decisions that are orthogonal to

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,870
a system's prescriptive architecture. That is, they're not included

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,080
in, encompassed by, or implied by the prescriptive architecture.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,300
And the result of Architectural Drift is that you

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,220
start from a clean architecture, like the one that I'm

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,830
showing here, and then you start adding pieces without following a clear plan.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,229
Like, for example, here, we add an additional room here, but we don't really

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,380
do it in the right way so we need to add something else

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,090
to keep it stable. And then maybe we want some more room so we

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,310
add a tent. And then another side of the house, it doesn't really

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,540
follow the same architecture but it doesn't matter, we just put it there because

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,690
we want to expand. And maybe then we want to put something classic

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,210
there, even though it doesn't really fit

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,520
the overall design and the overall architecture.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,160
So I think you get my point, the fact

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,210
that the architecture then becomes unnecessarily complex, hard to understand

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,410
and ultimately awkward, just like the one that I'm

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,880
showing here, that goes from the original building into this

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,870
final monstrosity. The second concept is Architectural Erosion, which

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,560
is the introduction of architectural design decisions that violate a

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,070
system prescriptive architecture. So in this case, that we were

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,070
introducing decisions that were orthogonal,

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,580
here, were introducing this decisions

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,410
that don't comply with the prescriptive

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,140
architecture. And the result of Architectural Erosion

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,590
is typically a poor architecture an

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,550
architecture that is going to have problems in

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,040
the future. So both Architectural Drift

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,640
and Architectural Erosion take you away in

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,940
different ways from what you think your software architecture is or should be.
