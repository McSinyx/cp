The last topic I want to cover in

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,939
this lesson is architectural styles. So, let's see

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,400
what those architectural styles are. There are certain

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,240
design choices that when applied in a given context

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,420
regularly result in solutions with superior properties. What

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,290
this means is that, compared to other possible alternatives,

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,952
these solutions are more elegant, effective, efficient, dependable,

8
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:25,560
evolve-able, scale-able, and so on. Architectural styles capture exactly

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,490
these solutions. They capture idioms that we can

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,870
use when designing a system. For a more formal

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,160
definition, let's look how Mary Shaw and David Garlan

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,480
define a architectural style. They say that an architectural

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,000
style defines a family of systems in terms

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,550
of a pattern of structural organization; a vocabulary of

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,880
components and connectors and constraints on how these components

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,620
and connectors can be combined. So in summary we

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,650
can say that an architectural style is a named collection

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,680
of architectural design decisions applicable in a given context. And I

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,100
want to stress that it is important to study and

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,670
know these architectural styles for several reasons. Because knowing them allows

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,660
us to avoid reinventing the wheel. It also allows us

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,330
to choose the right solution to a known problem and in

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,910
some cases it even allows us to move on and

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,400
discover even more advanced styles if we know the basic ones.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,340
So we should be familiar with architectural styles, what

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,000
they are, and in which context they work, and

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
in which context they do not work. So as

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,090
to be able to apply them in the right situations.
