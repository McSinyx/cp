Hello and welcome to a tale of analysis and design, featuring

2
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:10,809
Spencer Rugaber, as the librarian, and Alex Orso,

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,779
as the software engineer. [SOUND]

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:21,520
>> Hi! I'm here waiting for Spencer, my librarian friend. He needs some

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,470
help developing an information system for a library. So I asked him to write

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,669
down the requirements for the libra... Oh, [SOUND] that must be him.

7
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:30,850
>> Hello Alex.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,470
>> Hey Spencer. How's it going?

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,690
>> Good. Did you get those requirements I emailed you?

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,890
>> Oh, you emailed them. Now let me check.

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,780
And, by the way, get some coffee for you here.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,880
>> Thank you very much.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,790
>> Oh yeah. They're right here. Let me see. Oh, good. Oh, yeah,

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,580
good. We have, what we need. So the, the way I like to do

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,500
this is. I like to start by

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,430
looking at the requirements and identifying the nouns

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,530
in the requirements, because those tell us

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,080
the kind of the relevant elements in the,

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,360
in the requirements. So if you don't mind we can start looking at those and

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,070
you can tell me you know, whether the ones that I am identifying make sense or not.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,920
>> Sounds good.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,500
>> All right.
