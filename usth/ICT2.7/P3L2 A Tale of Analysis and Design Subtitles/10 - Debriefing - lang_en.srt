1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,200
>> So Spencer, now that we went through

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,340
this process and, I'd just like to hear

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,090
whether you enjoyed it, whether you think it

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,640
was useful. What are your thoughts?

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,661
>> Well, ti was very interesting. I not only

6
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:16,541
learned something about computers and about how you design information systems

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,713
in UML, but I, it was interesting. I also learned something

8
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:25,290
interesting about the library. And things that, that I knew but

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,920
I never really, explicitly written down.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,099
>> Uh-huh.

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,280
>> Came up during the course of doing this. And I think I now

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,800
much better understand what this information system that you're

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,590
going to build for us, is really all about.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,480
>> Okay, well, I mean, I'm very happy that you say

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
that, because I really believe that, you know, doing this kind

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,870
of analysis and design exercises really helps you figuring out whether

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,480
there's any issues with the requirements. So for example, you can find

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,580
out whether there's any missing information, or maybe conflicting

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
information. And I think that's exactly what happened today.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,120
So I'm very glad to hear that it worked for you. That you enjoyed it. I hope you

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,690
enjoyed it as well. And I strongly encourage you

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,000
to do this kind of exercises for different kinds

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,630
of systems. So as you can become more familiar

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,410
with analysis and design techniques. So, any final thoughts?

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,440
>> I look forward to receiving your delivered software.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
>> All right. Will do.
