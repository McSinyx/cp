1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,460
Spencer, I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,441
You're getting very good at this. So, why

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,190
don't you go wild and continue, there

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,240
anything else you think we can improve here?

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,800
>> Well something was bothering

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,600
me, that what happens if there's more

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,110
than one book with the same title and somebody puts in a request?

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,360
>> Oh, I see. That's a good point. So basically what you are telling me is

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,630
there's kind of a difference between an item and

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,660
the title, so the title is kind of a more

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,940
general concept, in a sense. So if you can

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,830
have multiple copies of a given title, is that right?

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,460
>> Yeah, we have five copies of Tom Sawyer, and the

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,810
persons, the patrons, really putting in a request for any Tom Sawyer.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,332
>> They don't want like copy number three of Tom Sawyer, right? They want,

16
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:50,530
they want to read Tom Sawyer. Okay and I can represent that. So, in which

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,230
I suggest we do that, and you can tell me whether it makes sense to you is by

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,650
introducing an additional class, which I call Title. And

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,614
that represents exactly the concept that you're mentioning. So

20
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,666
this is a title which represents some

21
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:09,180
specific content. That is not related to a specific

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,110
physical element. Like it can be rated to multiple,

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,520
physical elements. So basically I'm going to create this title.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,100
And then I'm going to create a relationship between

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,500
the title and the item. And what

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,530
the relationship is telling me, the the association

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,512
between these two in this case. Is an association,

28
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:30,320
that we call aggregation. So it's a special kind of association, that basically

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,450
indicates that an item of this type, so a title can

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,692
consist of a multiple elements of this type of multiple items.

31
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,710
So it's telling me that one title can

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,700
consist of multiple items, and I'm going to indicate

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,560
it with this annotation, which is a this

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,200
diamond at the top of the association.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,570
>> And so we can move our request

36
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,510
line, up from loanable item to

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,010
title, because that's what they're really requesting.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,710
>> Definitely, definitely, and in fact,

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,420
you know, that represents exactly the situation

40
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,350
that you are mentioning, at this point when the patron makes a request.

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,240
It makes a request to a title and not to a loanable item. And then, and

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,420
when the actual loan will take place,

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,420
then that will be connected to a specific item.

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,090
>> Right. Okay that makes sense.

45
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,388
>> Makes sense?

46
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:20,779
>> Yeah.

47
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:21,214
>> Okay, good.
