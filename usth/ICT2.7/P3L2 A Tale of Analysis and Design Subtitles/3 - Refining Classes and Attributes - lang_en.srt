1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,920
Okay, so this is our first, class diagram.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,260
>> So, let me ask you something about.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:06,520
>> Okay.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,930
>> What we've done so far. I also sent, in what

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,490
I sent you, I also had some stories about how the actual

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,400
>> Library is used. You asked me to do

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,950
that and are we going to take, use that here?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,300
>> Glad you asked actually. yeah. Those are, you know, what we call use

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,940
cases, or what we will use as scenarios kind of things that we will

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,340
use to derive use cases. And they're also a very good

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,450
way of extracting requirements. We're not going to look at them right

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,890
now because now, because we're more working on kind of the static

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,860
structure of the system. But after we're done with the class diagram,

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,700
you know, we will do it at a different time. But

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,410
we're going to use those to see how the

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,850
libraries actually use them, and see whether we can get more

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,000
information that we can use to refine our requirements based on that.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,770
>> Okay.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,020
>> Okay,

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,940
So, for now, we'll just focus in on the,

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,630
structure, but, just so you know, I'm,

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,870
I'm glad you sent them, because they were going

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,380
very useful as well.

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,840
Okay. So let's see. Well, first of all, let

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,030
me, seems like that this is already pretty crowded,

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,770
right? We have a number of, classes. So let's

27
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,580
see if there's, some class that may be superfluous and

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,310
we can model in a different way. So, for

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,360
example, you, while, while thinking of this I was thinking,

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,450
the library card, it doesn't really contain much

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,736
information, right? So is it basically just the number?

32
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:23,948

33
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:30,760
The card has a number on it. We have a separate vendor that does that for us so.

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:30,810
>> Oh.

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,270
>> We don't need, it doesn't need to be part of this system,

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,450
we just have to make sure that every patron has a library card.

37
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,670
>> Okay, so basically for you, in a sense, the library

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,560
card is just an ID that gets associated with a patron.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,120
>> That's right.

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,380
>> So I think that the best way to represent this, I mean, unless you

41
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,000
need an entity because you are creating it

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,160
yourself, but it seems like you are not.

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,710
I would just remove this one and I would like to put this,

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,020
basically to take the library card number and add it to the pattern.

45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,100
>> Okay, makes sense.

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,000
>> Okay, so I'll add it here. And as

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,160
an additional attribute. Okay, and it will eliminate this class.

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,410
>> Okay.

49
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,580
>> Okay.

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,700
Oh, and, wait a second, so I guess

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,940
also the child needs a library card number, right?

52
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,320
>> Child needs a library card number, but let me ask you about that. Is,

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,050
is child a separate class, or is it just another kind of patron?

54
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,920
>> Oh, I see, I see. Because, yeah, it

55
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,490
is sort of a special patron, right? And, so

56
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,730
maybe we should, maybe we should represent it as

57
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,640
a kind of a refinement of the patron.

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,730
Hm, but then that made me think. So what is

59
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,510
the only thing that characterizes children? Is it just the age?

60
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,440
>> Well, if they're, that they can't check out more than five books.

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,890
>> Okay. And the, and the only difference is the

62
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,010
fact that they are less than, you know, twelve years old.

63
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,710
>> Twelve or less, right.

64
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,090
>> Twelve or less. So, I guess, you know, I would probably

65
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,120
like to represent this by making the age explicit in the patron rather

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,730
than to represent it as a class. And I'll tell you why,

67
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,300
because one, one of the issues, and you know, that might happen

68
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,070
again, is that, basically, there are patrons that are children. And they're

69
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,130
no longer children, when they come you know 13 or older right.

70
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,100
>> Right.

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,990
>> And if we represent them with a separate class in a sense, then we

72
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,620
cannot really change the type of an instance of these classes.

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,920
So we're left to kind of destroy the patron, create

74
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,190
a new one, so that means we also have to transfer

75
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,510
any history we want to keep history and so on.

76
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,680
So I, I think I kind of like better the idea

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,560
that I represent the age exclusively in

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,700
the patron, and then I'll behave differently, based on whether the

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,910
patron is 12 years old, or younger, or 13 or,

80
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,600
13 or older. This, do you see any problem with that?

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,210
>> It makes things a little simpler.

82
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,490
>> Okay,

83
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,550
and we actually, it allows us also to eliminate

84
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,450
one class here. So I'm going to proceed this way.

85
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,450
I'm going to eliminate the children class, and I'm going to

86
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,600
put the age in the patron. Okay, and let me

87
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,020
see. But in this spirit, actually, something else that jumps

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,740
at me is this idea of the bestseller, because I

89
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,850
kind of feel like, we might have the same

90
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,085
problem. So, what is the story? What is a bestseller.

91
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,850
>> Well it's

92
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,750
an item that we want to restrict how

93
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,896
long people can keep, because there is such demand for it.

94
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,880
>> I see, and so basically a book that's a

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,450
bestseller, like the New York Times bestseller, is a bestseller forever?

96
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,683
>> No, no, no it's hot for

97
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:35,940
awhile, and then it becomes just a regular item.

98
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,318
>> I see. Hm. Then I guess it's a

99
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:40,349
similar situation to the one I was mentioning before, right?

100
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:40,980
>> Okay.

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,800
>> That if we have a book,

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,530
it will kind of have to change its type if it becomes a best seller.

103
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,218
Then we have to change its type again, if it's no longer a best seller.

104
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:47,790
>> Right.

105
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,920
>> So it seems to me that a better

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,150
way to represent this, is just to eliminate this BestSeller

107
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,060
class and instead, I'm going to put the best seller

108
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,190
attribute, which would just be a Boolean in the book.

109
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,190
>> Okay, what do you mean by Boolean?

110
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,280
>> Right. We don't know what Boolean is, right? The Boolean is

111
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,940
basically just a number. It can have two values, right? True or false.

112
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,380
>> Okay.

113
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,830
>> So we usually, normally use it

114
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,510
in this in this case. Imagine one, zero,

115
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,970
right? Then it's just kind of the basic.

116
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,120
>> Okay.

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,250
>> You know, the bits, right?

118
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,590
>> Okay.

119
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,730
>> So, this is just telling us, it's like a flag

120
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,672
that is telling this book is a best seller, or not.

121
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:17,053
>> Okay.

122
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,920
>> It's very easy to change this value and make a book a best

123
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,880
seller or not a best seller, than

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,210
just creating and destroying instances of these classes.

125
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,135
>> Okay, makes sense.

126
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:32,630
>> Okay, so at this point, this already looks better, right? Because we have,

127
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,590
less classes, and I think we did, yeah, we

128
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,775
did some serious cleanup. That's good. Okay, so now that

129
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,975
we eliminated some of this, what I would like to

130
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,845
do, as I said, we are going to both clean

131
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:45,222
up, but also refine. I would like to go

132
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,826
back to our, requirements and see whether we can identify

133
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:52,566
additional attributes for this, class that maybe are not as

134
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,120
obvious as the one that we saw so far, okay?
