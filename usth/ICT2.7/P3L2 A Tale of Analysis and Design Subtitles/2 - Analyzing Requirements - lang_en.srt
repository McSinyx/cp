1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,900
Okay so let me start underlining these nouns, and I'll start

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,810
identifying the ones that are relevant, and I'll ask you some

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,550
questions or you can ask me questions if

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,666
you see something that doesn't make sense to you. Good enough.

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,650
>> okay, let's see, patron. It seems to

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,670
me that patron is definitely an important entity.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,808
>> That's, that's what its all about.

8
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,270
>> Okay, all right, so actually, the way

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,750
I'm going to do this, I'm going to take all these relevant

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,610
entities and I'm going to start putting them into what I call a class

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,450
diagram. So you don't really need to know what that is exactly, but imagine

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,150
this being a, a diagram in which I'm drawing, I represent in all development

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,260
items as rectangles with a given name and, and then later on some attributes.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,660
>> Okay.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,055
>> Okay, and I'm, I'm just going to put

16
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,600
them there. So I'm going to start with patron.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm going to create one class for the

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,250
patron. I'm going to give it the name patron.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,120
And by the way, assuming that you'd probably figure out, it's important that we

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,430
represent, we use the right names so that it's clear when we're looking at

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,790
the class diagram what we're referring to, so I'll just use the, the nouns

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,520
themselves as names. Okay, library card seems to be also a relevant element.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,072
>> Every patron has a library card.

24
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,530
>> All right, perfect, so we'll just

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,880
create a library card here. And let's see.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,530
As, as long as they're in the system. And I saw that there's a system

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,000
here, this concept of system, this concept

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,076
of library. And based on my experience, normally,

29
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:26,574
those are kind of in an overarching themes. So this is really what we are

30
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:28,597
modeling. So the only

31
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,297
thing that will make a difference is

32
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:34,120
if there were more than one library or more than one system. Is that the case?

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,740
>> We just want one system for our one library

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,770
>> Okay so, in this case I won't even represent

35
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,540
those because basically what I'm representing is the system and

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:41,990
the library.

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,740
>> I understand, I understand.

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,420

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,350
Okay and then, oh name, address and phone

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,510
number are interesting because these are important entities,

41
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,180
but this seems like, you know, they're not

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,550
entities in themselves, so they're more attributes

43
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,070
of something else. I would imagine that

44
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,080
this is the way you identify, or these

45
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,860
are elements that are important for the patron?

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,880
>> That's what we take down when we issue the cards.

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
>> Okay. Perfect. So, I'm going to

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,710
take those and make those attributes of the patron, which means

49
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,350
that I'm going to take the class that I created before, and I'm

50
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,430
just going to write them down here so that they're represented and,

51
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,360
and we know that these are kind of what characterizes the patron.

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,070
>> Gotcha.

53
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,540
>> Okay? And then, I guess similar consideration for the library

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,750
card number. So this is to be associated with the library card?

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,902
>> It's printed right on it.

56
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:32,180
>> All right, so we'll put this as

57
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,130
an attribute of the library card, then. And then, in addition, at any particular point

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,630
in time. Okay, so time seems to be a relevant entity right,

59
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,880
because time seems to occur several times in this description. For example, I

60
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,940
think you guys keep track of how long a book has been loaned, right?

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,300
>> Right.

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,270
>> And there's some time associated also here.

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,380
>> And a children's age.

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,760
>> Oh yeah. The children's age here that

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,200
I didn't see before. Yeah. So, what

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm going to do, I'm going to represent this in

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
a sort of generic way, as a date.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
>> Okay.

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,380
>> These are kind of, kind of classes, utility

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,880
classes we call them, that are normally in every system.

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:10,970
>> Okay.

72
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,060
>> So I'm just going to put it down here

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,940
as a utility class that will be used

74
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,780
by different elements in the diagram. Okay, so

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,070
I want to calculate the items. So the items also

76
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,230
I mean I for what I know about libraries they

77
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,490
seem to be pretty relevant elements, right? So these are all

78
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,305
>> This is what we check out, this is what we're for.

79
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:34,459
>> Okay, so then items definitely will become a

80
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,349
class, and then we have a due. Oh there's also

81
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,730
this concept of fines. I guess that seems to be

82
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,330
important. Right? You guys give fines to people who are late.

83
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,700
>> Right, right.

84
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,160
>> Right, collect fines and so on. So we create a fine class down here and

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,150
the children. So children are special customers, right? It's

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,890
their age makes a difference? Is that the way it works?

87
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,950
>> Right. They, they can only check out a few books.

88
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,410
>> Okay. So I'll create them a special

89
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,170
kind of case, a special kind of customer so

90
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,000
I just create here a class for children. And

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,682
I can see that they're categorized by their age.

92
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,340
>> Right.

93
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,160
>> So I'll just put the age here as an attribute of the child.

94
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,712
And, okay, so the next one is

95
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:19,653
restriction. And restriction is kind of tricky because just

96
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:22,010
to be sort of a general concept. I mean,

97
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,915
in a sense, all of those are restrictions, right?

98
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:28,250
>> Right, this is just another one of these requirements.

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,180
>> Oh, okay, so, so we don't need to represent it explicitly, right?

100
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,430
>> Right, right.

101
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,390
>> It's just telling us how the children, yeah, okay, right; this is

102
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,151
just another requirement, so I just won't consider that for now. And oh,

103
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:43,444
I see that these books and audio video materials, I guess these

104
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:48,902
are things that the patrons can check out, right?

105
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,725
>> Those are some of the items, right.

106
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,770
>> There are two

107
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,380
more down here, right? Reference books and magazines?

108
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,990
>> But, they can't be checked

109
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,270
out, but they're definitely in the library.

110
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,338
>> Okay, so then I'm going to represent all of those

111
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,180
actually, now. So, I'm going to have books, I'm going to have audio

112
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,990
video materials, reference books, and magazines. And

113
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,150
I'm just going to have those as classes. Then,

114
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,060
okay here we have week, and we

115
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,630
already represented this general concept of time, so

116
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,270
week will be represented by the date class as well. And oh, I see best sellers.

117
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,520
So best sellers are also, I guess, items that can be checked out, right?

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,150
>> Right.

119
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,330
>> Okay, so I'll

120
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,900
just represent those as a class as well and an additional item that

121
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,480
is relevant for the library. And the limit, this is also a time limit, right?

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,150
>> Right.

123
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,500
>> So it can also be represented with a, with a class.

124
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,380
Oh, here we have cents, and for cents, same consideration that made

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,430
for time. This is kind of the money, is a general concept

126
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,240
that in all currency, many, in many IT systems. So, I'm, I'm

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,430
going to just have a money class here, which is another utility class.

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,740
>> Okay

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,000
>> Okay, and, oh, here I have value, so value is a property.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,320
Let me look again at the requirement. Oh, it's the value of the item. So value

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,450
I'm going to put in the item as an attribute. Okay?

132
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,120
>> Okay. That's how much it cost us.

133
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,090
>> Okay. Perfect.

134
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,400
>> Seems like we got them all. Right? Anything I forgot?

135
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,640
>> That looks like it.

136
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,580
>> Okay, so this one, what I'd like to do. We have a kind of

137
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,890
a first take, first cut at the class diagram. I'd like to kind of

138
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,480
move to that and go through the different classes with you. And I'll ask

139
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,440
you some questions again. And you can

140
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,510
tell me whether there is something that

141
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,894
jumps at you that's not right. And

142
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,930
then we're going to try to refine that.

143
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,180
>> Okay

144
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,510
>> Okay.

145
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,800
>> Sounds good.
