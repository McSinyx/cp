1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,276
>> And before we get started actually, I'd like to mention that there's

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:05,124
just, you know, FYI, there's different kinds

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,708
of verbs because what I'm looking for

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:10,099
is really action verbs. So verb, verbs that clearly express an action that

5
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,580
can tell me that, you know, what, for example, an item could do, 'kay?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:13,820
>> Okay?

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,620
>> Not the verbs that represent, for example, relationships, 'kay?

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,076
>> Okay.

9
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,080
>> So, and the, there, and the ones

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,020
that I've identified und, underlined here actually, I,

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,158
I underlined complete sentences so that you kind of we can look at the verbs in

12
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:29,150
in context. And the first one is this

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,850
sentence that says that the library may need

14
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,190
to know or to calculate the items a

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,790
patron has checked out, when they are due, and

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,860
any outstanding overdue fines. So I, I will

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,430
imagine that this is representing a situation in

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,224
which you bring up a patron's record and

19
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:46,131
you start looking up this information. Is that [CROSSTALK]

20
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,970
>> The, the patron often wants to know what they have currently checked out.

21
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,044
>> Oh,

22
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:51,282
alright.

23
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:53,260
>> Or when are their due or how much they're owed or.

24
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,100
>> Oh, in fact, and then now that you mentioned it,

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
I think you sent me. One of the scenarios you sent

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,400
me had to do with that, right, with the patron coming

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,930
in and asking for this information. So yeah, and it makes

28
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,025
a lot of sense. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to

29
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:10,520
model this by adding this three operations to the patron method.

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,410
The first one, I'm going to call, itemsCheckedOut and, basically, it's an

31
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,520
operation, but you don't need to, you know, understand the implementation

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,820
details, but when you call this operation, it will

33
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,770
give you back exactly this information, so the items

34
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,864
that are checked out by that patron. The second

35
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,965
one, I'm going to call it whenDue. That will tell you

36
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:29,080
basically when a, when an item is due. And

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,550
the third one is going to be called the outstandingOverdueFines and,

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,510
you know, as the name says, it's going to tell

39
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,860
you what are the outstanding overdue fines for that patron.

40
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,300
>> Okay.

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,306
>> And as you might notice I mean,

42
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:41,843
I, I'm going to separate the, the, the attributes

43
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:44,085
from the operations by having a separate kind

44
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,386
of subrectangle so, in this way, it's clear

45
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,274
what is attribute and what is, what is

46
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,000
an attribute and what's an, what's an operation.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,420
>> Gotcha.

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,540
>> And let me see then. Okay, for the

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,040
second one you can see that that patron can check

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,990
out books and audio visual materials. So I guess,

51
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,880
similarly you, you build kind of the record for a patron.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,150
The patron will give you an item and you will record

53
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,020
the fact that the patron is kind of checking it out.

54
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,730
>> Right. And is that operation related to this,

55
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,150
the checked out attribute that we did a minute ago?

56
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,495
>> It is actually because what will happen then again, you know, if we jump

57
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:24,975
ahead a little bit would be that every time you invoke this operation. So I'm

58
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,810
going to represent this as a checkOut operation

59
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,896
for the patron. Every time you invoke this,

60
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,920
you will also have to say something about the item and so we will also

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,700
flip kind of that that, that build information in the, in the, in the item.

62
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,904
>> Okay.

63
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:39,680
>> Mm, 'kay? And, and finally, here, I can see that

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,660
a patron can request a book or an audio video item Is

65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,240
not currently in. So I guess this is referring to items that

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,980
are already checked out but for which there is interest. Is that?

67
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,770
>> Right. So, particularly, the popular items the patrons want to get on

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,140
the list so that they get notified when it comes back in and.

69
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,204
>> Oh.

70
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:57,730
>> And check it out.

71
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,570
>> I see. I see. Okay. Then I'm going to do

72
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,400
the same thing here. I'm, I'm going to add this method,

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,510
which I'm going to call request and I'm going to put it

74
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,340
here in the list of the methods in the list.

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,450
>> Okay.

76
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,810
>> Of operations for the, for the patron, okay?
