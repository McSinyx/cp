1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,202
Okay. So this is what I've done as you see,

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:06,130
it looks a little nicer than it was before. And I didn't

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,530
really change that much. I just made a few changes, so

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,560
I just wanted to point them out to you, so that you

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,690
know what they are. And the main thing, one of the

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,210
main things I did is really to introduce these derived attributes. So

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,860
these are attributes that are basically

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,520
computed. Based on some other attributes.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,010
Okay, they don't have a value themselves, but their value is computed.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,900
And I used two. The first one is age. So

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,930
basically we know the age of the patron based on

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,920
the birthday, of the patron. So you guys, I don't

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,150
know if you have that information currently in the system.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,480
>> No, we'll have to add that to the

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,280
form patrons fill out, when they get their card.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,255
>> Is that, that an issue? Can you do it?

17
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,130
>> No yes, we, we can easily do that.

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,670
>> Okay, so then, perfect. So we'll do it that way. I think it's

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,310
a, in a little cleaner. And similarly, since you told me that the fine

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,480
was computed based on the amount of days that an

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,310
item was late. The patron was late returning the item, then I

22
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,010
also added this as a derived attribute that is computed based on

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,140
the due date and when the item is actually returned.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,780
>> Makes sense.

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,389
>> Makes sense? Okay. And the rest

26
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:10,590
is kind of really minor things. So the, the only one I

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,340
want to point out is I didn't, you know, discuss that with

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,260
you before, but I added this, which is called cardinality

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,700
for some of these relationships. And what they say is basically

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,360
is how many elements are involved in the relationship.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,580
>> So, you mean the stars?

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,960
>> Yeah, like the stars and the one...

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,290
>> Okay.

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,380
>> Here for example, this is telling you that for each item there

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,490
is only one title. And that for each title, there are multiple items.

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,490
>> So, star means many.

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,716
>> Stars mean many, yeah.

38
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:39,045
>> Okay, go you.

39
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,321
>> Sorry that's kind of computer science lingo - we use the star

40
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:45,500
for that kind of stuff. And, similarly, for the patron, it's

41
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,510
telling me that, you know, each patron can have multiple, can

42
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,550
request multiple titles, and that the same title can be requested

43
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,650
by multiple patrons, which I think is the way the system works.

44
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,080
>> Right. So except for these minor changes,

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,850
we already had a pretty good model in our hands, so

46
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,620
I think is a, we can finalize this and then just

47
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,350
move to the low level design and then implementation, and be

48
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,970
done with the system.

49
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,979
>> Sounds good.
