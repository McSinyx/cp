1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,830
Before looking at additional actions, though, I would like to

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,770
see what is the basic workflow in a version control system

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,370
using the three actions that we just saw. And to

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,760
do that I'm going to use two of our friends, Brad

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,590
and Janet. So we have Janet here, Brad, and a

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,440
VCS that they are using. Now imagine that Janet creates a

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,020
file called foo.txt and puts some information in the file.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,250
At that point she might want to add the file to

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,340
the repository and to commit it so that her changes

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,210
and the file get to the central repository. And when she

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,900
adds and commit, that's exactly what will happen, in foo

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,870
will be come available here, and will be accessible to the

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,330
other users. In this case it'll be accessible to Brad.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,190
If Brett were to run an update command, what will happen

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,800
is that the file foo.txt will be copied on the local

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,460
work space of Brad and Brad will be able to access

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,980
the file. At this point Brad might want to modify

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,110
the file, for example add something to this existing file.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,410
After doing that, he also may want to share the

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,900
updated file with Janet. To do that, he will commit the

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,070
file and the result will be exactly the same of

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,470
when Janet committed her file. That the updated file will

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,890
be sent to the repository and the repository will store

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,570
that information and make it available for other users. So now,

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,290
if Janet performs an update, she will get the

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,860
new version of foo.txt with the additional information that was

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,950
added by Brad. And we will see all of this

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,350
in action in our next demo in a few minutes.
