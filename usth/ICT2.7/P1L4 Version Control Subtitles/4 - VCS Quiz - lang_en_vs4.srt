Now before we continue, and we look at more details

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,400
of version control systems, I want to ask you a

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,230
quick question about VCS. I want to know whether you

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,190
have used a version control system before, and if so,

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,090
which one or which ones. I'm going to list in

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,260
here some of the most commonly used version control systems,

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,840
like CVS, Subversion, GIT, and I'm also allowing you to

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,640
specify other VCS in case you have used different ones.
