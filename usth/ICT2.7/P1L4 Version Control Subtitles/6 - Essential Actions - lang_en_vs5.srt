1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,220
What I want to do next, is to look at how

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,780
version control systems actually work. We saw what they are. We

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,130
saw why they are useful. But how do they actually work?

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,460
And we're going to do that by starting from some essential

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,400
actions that version control systems perform. The first one is the

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,920
addition of files. So, when you use a version control system,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,280
you can add a file to the repository. And at that

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,400
point the file will be accessible to other people who have access

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,640
to the repository. And now the fundamental action is commit.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,230
When you change a file, a file that is already in

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,610
the repository, when you make some local changes to a

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,430
file that is already in the repository, you want then to

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,460
commit your changes to the central repository, so they can

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,990
become visible to all of the other users on the repository. Finally,

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,770
another fundamental action is the action of updating a file. If

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,650
we have a repository and someone else can modify the files

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,800
in the repository, I want to be able to get

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,550
the changes that other people made to the files in the

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,980
repository. And these are just three of the basic actions, but

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,870
there are many, many more. And we'll see several of those.
