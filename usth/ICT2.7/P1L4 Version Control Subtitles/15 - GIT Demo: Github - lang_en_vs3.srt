00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,820
In the interview that we did at the beginning of the class,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,430
we talked with John about GitHub, where GitHub is a Git hosting website, and

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,390
John told you all about it. For this class, we will be

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,350
using GitHub as our Git hosting. Let's see how GitHub works in practice and

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,450
let's see some of the common features offered by GitHub.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,010
This is what we'll do in the third part of this Git demo. What I'm showing here

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,550
is the GitHub website and as I said, GitHub is a Git hosting website and

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,950
you can create an account on GitHub by simply signing up on the website. And

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,100
because we already have an account that we're simply going to sign in

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,570
to see what kind of functionality GitHub offers. And we're going to specify our

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,190
username and password. And as you can see on the GitHub website,

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,695
you can use this menu up on the right to create a new repository or

13
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:51,500
change the account settings. Let's click on our user profile. And

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,270
here we can see some statistics for our user. For

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,190
example, we can see statistic about our contributions and our repositories. So

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,560
now if we go to the Repositories view, we can create a new repository.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,117
We give it a name. Let's call it myrepo. We can provide the description for

18
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:11,680
the repository. If we want, we can initialize the repository by adding a README

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,860
file. And even though we are not doing it right now, if you can see up here,

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,820
you can also add a license here on the right and it allows you

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,831
to choose from a set of predefined licenses. And you can also a .gitignore file,

22
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,410
which, in case you don't know what that is, it's a very convenient file that

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,740
will automatically exclude from the repositories file that should not be added.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,690
So if you remember in the lesson we said there are things that you should not

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,263
add to the repositories. For example, derived files. So

26
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:42,360
here, using this menu, you can pick the type of project that you have.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,740
For example, Java project or PHP project or many other kinds of projects. And

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,510
the GitHub will automatically add that file for you.

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,680
But let's skip that for now and simply create our repository. And

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,000
that creates a repository that contains the README file because that's what we

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,580
decided to do. And it also allows you to edit the README file by clicking on it.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,560
It will bring up an editor and here you can write, you know,

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,949
for example, initial readme for your project. Then you can add your

34
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,070
commit message up there and then you can commit the changes to your README file.

35
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,212
The site also provides many other features, like, for example, creating issues,

36
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:22,030
pull requests, adding and editing a wiki, and also, you know,

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,740
defining other characteristics and settings for the repository. Now, if we go to

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,500
the repository, you can see that we also get the HTTPS link for the repository.

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,870
So this is the URL that you can use to clone your repository. If you remember,

40
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,250
with a git clone command, that's the URL that you can specify. So

41
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,480
let's try to do that and clone that repository. So we're going to copy this URL.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,300
To do that, we're going to execute git clone and specify the URL that we

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,310
just copied. And you can see that the project was created, was cloned locally.

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,760
And if we go under myrepo, which is the name of the repository, you can see that

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,570
the README file that we created on GitHub is here. So if we create a new file,

46
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,340
which we're going to call again, newFile just to be clear. And then we

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,920
can add it, commit it, specifying as usual a commit message. So at this point,

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,940
we can push our locked out changes to the remote GitHub repository. And

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,340
because the GitHub repository is password protected,

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,660
we have to specify our login and password. And of course, if you

51
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,770
pass the wrong password, GitHub is not going to let you in. So let's try again.

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,110
Let's try to get the password right this time. I'm going to specify again,

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:31,130
my login and my password. At this point, the push is successful and

54
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,220
my changes are actually pushed to the master, which is the GitHub repository.

55
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,020
To double check that, let's go back to the GitHub repository and as you can see,

56
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,470
that the file that we added, newFile, is there as expected. And of course,

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,880
there's many more things that you can do on the GitHub website, so

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,410
I strongly encourage you to go and try out things. But

59
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,980
the key message here is that the GitHub is a Git hosting website where you

60
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,990
can get an account and create your remote repositories.
