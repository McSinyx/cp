Hi and welcome to the second lesson on tools of the trade. In the

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,710
previous lesson we talked about IDEs. Integrated

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,300
Development Environments and in particular we discussed

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,460
the eclipse ID. Today we're going to

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,780
talk about another fundamental type of tools

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,840
in the software engineering arena. Version control

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,140
systems. And these are also called, revision

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,620
or source control systems. In particular, we will focus on a

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,320
specific version control system called git. And as we did for eclipse,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,510
we will first present git from a conceptual standpoint. And then

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,200
we will do a demo. To get some hands-on experience with GIT.
