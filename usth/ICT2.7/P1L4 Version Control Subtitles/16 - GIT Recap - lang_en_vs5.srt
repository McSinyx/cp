Now that we are done with our demo, I just want

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:05,910
to go through a quick GIT recap to remind you of the

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,720
main commands that we saw, and what they do. And you can

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,290
also use these as sort of a reference when you work with

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,940
GIT. And by the way, if you look around and you do

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,960
a search, you can see that there's tons of examples on the

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,170
web of GitHub tutorials, videos, examples, manuals. So feel free to

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,910
explore. And I'm actually going to put some references to tutorials and

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,100
videos that I found particularly useful in the notes for the class.
