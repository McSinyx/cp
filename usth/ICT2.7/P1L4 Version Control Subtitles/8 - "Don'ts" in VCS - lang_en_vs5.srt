00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,020
Before getting to the demo, I want to say a few

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,550
more things. In particular, I discuss the main don'ts in VCS. So,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,110
what are some things that you don't want to do, and

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,687
you should not do, when you're using a version control system? And

5
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,382
I'm going to mention two, in particular, because these are two

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,028
that I witnessed several times when I was teaching this class and

7
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,820
also when collaborating with other people. So, there are two kinds

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,460
of resources that you don't want to add to a VCS normally.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,070
One is derived files. For example an executable that is

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,930
derived by compiling a set of source files, where the

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,480
source files all already in the repository. At that point,

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,680
there is no reason to also add the executable file in

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,150
the repository. So in general, any executable file should not

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,570
be added to repository. The second class of files that I

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,760
want to mention is these bulky binary files. If you

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,600
have one such file, it is normally not a good idea

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,430
to store them under a version control system, to store them

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,670
in the repository. There might be exceptions to these rules, but in

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,070
general, these are the kind of files that you want to

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,540
keep local, and you don't want to put in the VCS repository.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,500
Another typical mistake, and that happens all the time, especially to

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,650
novice users of VCS. Is that you get your file from VCS

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,120
and so you get your local copy of the file that

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,270
was in the VCS, and you want to make some changes, and

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,090
before making the changes you decided, no, no let me actually save

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,410
a local copy of the file, and I'm going to work on

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,950
that one. Or let me save it before I modify it, or

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,350
let take a snap shot of a whole tree of files. Just because

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,830
I don't really trust the fact that VCS is going to be

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,170
able to help and is going to be able to recover from possible

31
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,980
mistakes. Never ever do that. I have seen that done many times,

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,570
and it always leads to disasters. First of all it is useless, and

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,000
second it's risky. Because then what happens is that at

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,610
the time in which you have to turn in your assignment,

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,330
in the case you are doing an assignment, but even in

36
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,740
more serious situation, when you have to turn in your code,

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,620
for example to your colleagues. You always end up being confused

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,010
about which is the version that you're really using. So absolutely

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,262
no local copies. No local redundancy when you're using a version

40
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:06,798
control system. Trust the version control system, and trust the version

41
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:09,280
control system to be able to manage your versions. You

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,350
can always save it, commit it, retrieve previous versions, and you'll

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,530
be able to do everything that you can do by copying

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,240
the file yourself, and even more. So again, try the VCS.
