00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,960
SImilarly, let's go through some commands that you can run on

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,150
remote repositories. First command is the command to copy a repository,

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,840
which is git clone in which you get a remote repository and you make a lot of

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,850
copy in your working directory. The repository can be specified as a URL.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,230
It can be a local file, it can be specified using the HTTP or

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,070
the SSH protocol, and there's also other ways to do it.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,300
This creates a complete local copy of the repository, as it says, and links it

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,030
to the remote repository, which is what is called the origin. And if you want,

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,400
you could also actually link to the repository, later. Then the normal way of

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,800
receiving changes from a repository is to perform a git pull command. And we saw

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,345
that you can also perform the same operation through two commands, get fetch and

12
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:47,210
git merge. In case you want to inspect the changes before actually merging them,

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,550
before actually getting them in your local copy. And

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,940
if you want to send changes that you have in your local repository to

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,680
a remote repository, you will use the git push command.
