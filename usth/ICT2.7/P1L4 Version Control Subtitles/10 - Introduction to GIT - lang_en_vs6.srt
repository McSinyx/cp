One good representative of distributed version control systems, is

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,320
GIT. A distributed version control system that was initially designed

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,297
and developed by Linus Torvalds. I'm pretty sure you

4
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:14,140
know who Linus Torvalds is. He's basically this guy who

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,070
started and created the Linux operating system. And Linus

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,140
was unhappy with the existing version control systems, and wanted

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,610
a different one. He wanted to use it for maintaining

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,330
the Linux kernel. In particular, he wanted one with some

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,550
key characteristics. For example, the fact that it was distributed. He

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,470
wanted it to be fast. He wanted it to have a

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,660
simple design. And he wanted to have a strong support for

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,370
parallel branches, because many people were contributing to the kernel at the

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,620
same time. And therefore there many different branches of development. And

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,120
finally, he wanted for the virtual control system to be able to

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,070
handle large projects. As the Linux kernel is, and to do

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,480
it in an efficient way. So if you want to get an idea

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,210
of how popular GIT is today, there was a survey performed across the

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,330
Eclipse IDE users, and it showed that in 2013 GIT was used by

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,950
about 30% of the developers. So the, it had a 30% adoption rate.

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,430
So we will use a GIT as a version control system for the class.
