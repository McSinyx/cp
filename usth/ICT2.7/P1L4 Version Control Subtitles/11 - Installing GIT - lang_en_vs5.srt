00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,020
As we did for Eclipse, and IDEs in general, we want

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,133
to start a GIT in a hands on way. So we're going

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:08,425
to start by seeing how to install GIT. And GIT is also

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,440
multiplatform, so you can install it no matter what operating system you

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,980
are using, unless of course you are using some arcane operating system.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,530
But if you are using Linux, for instance, there should be a

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,608
package available that can install GIT for your specific distribution. If you're

8
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,460
using Mac OS, GIT is also available as part of XCode and

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,270
also as an independent package. Finally, if you're using Windows, GIT is

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,090
available as a package with an installer. In general, you can go

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,290
here to get information about how to get GIT, where to download

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,975
it, how to install it, and so on. So, now what I'd

13
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:42,312
like for you to do is to go, get GIT, install it,

14
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:45,469
in case you don't have it installed already on your machine. And

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,253
after that, you should be able to run GIT from the command

16
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,120
line. And, that's exactly what we're going to do through a demo.
