00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,730
In fact, software processes are normally characterized by several phases, what

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,240
we call the software phases, and only one of these phases is

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,970
mainly focused on coding. The other phases are meant to support

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,440
other parts of software development. The first of these phases is called

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,110
requirements engineering and that's the phase in which we talk to

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,640
the customer, to the stakeholders, whoever we are building the software for.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,120
And we try to understand what kind of system we need

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,650
to build. Then we use this information to define our design and

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,840
the design is the high-level structure, that then can become more

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,800
and more detailed, of our software system. Once we've defined our

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,180
design we can actually move to the next phase, which is

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,480
the implementation, in which we write code that implements the design which

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,630
we just defined. After implementing the code, we need to verify

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,510
and validate the code. We need to make sure that the code

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,930
behaves as intended. And finally, we need to maintain the code.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,992
And maintenance involves several activities like,

17
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:50,980
for example, adding new functionality or

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,568
eliminating bugs from the code or responding to problems that

19
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:57,420
were reported from the field after we released the software.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,020
We will look at all of these activities and of

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,670
the software development process in detail, in the rest of the

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,610
class. And for each activity, we will look at the

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,460
fundamental principles and how it is done currently. And in

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,780
some cases, we will also look at some advance ways

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,680
to do it. For example, more research approaches for that activity.
