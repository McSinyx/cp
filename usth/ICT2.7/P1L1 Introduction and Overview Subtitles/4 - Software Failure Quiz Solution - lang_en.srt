00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,600
As you probably guessed, these are not fireworks for the 4th of

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,670
July but, rather, the explosion of the Ariane 5, which happened 30 seconds

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,250
or so after takeoff due to a software error. And this is

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,020
just an example of what can go wrong when we don't build software

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,600
and we don't test and verify and perform quality assurance of software

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,540
in the right way, and quite an expensive one. In fact, to develop

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,250
and to build the Ariane 5 it took 10 years. The cost

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,240
was around $7 billion and there were $500 million of cargo on board.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,280
Luckily, at least there were no humans on the

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,400
rocket. And you can find more details in case

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,610
you're interested about the Ariane 5 accident in the

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,230
lesson notes. I put a couple of links there.
