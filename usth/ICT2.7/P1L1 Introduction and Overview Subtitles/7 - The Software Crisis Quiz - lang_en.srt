00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:02,480
So now let's take a quick break and have a recap

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,300
of what we just discussed. I want you to think about what

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,850
are the major causes of the software crisis. I'm going to provide you

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,250
a set of possibilities and I would like for you to mark

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,160
all that apply. Was that increasing costs of computers? Was it increasing

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,990
product complexity, or maybe the lack of programmers? Or was it, instead,

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,000
this slow programmers productivity growth? The

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,540
lack of funding for software engineering

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,210
research? The rise in demand for software? And finally, was it maybe

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,500
the lack of caffeine in software

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,570
development organizations? Again, mark all that apply.
