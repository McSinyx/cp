Hi, everybody, and welcome to the first lesson

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,970
of the Software Engineering Course. In this introductory lesson

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,820
I will first provide an overview of the

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,100
whole course and then try to answer two important

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,630
questions about software engineering, which are, what is

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,310
software engineering and why do we need it? And

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,370
to spice up the content a bit I

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,480
will also interview several experts in the software engineering

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,080
field from both academia and industry and ask them these

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,410
very questions. So without any further ado, let's begin the lesson.
