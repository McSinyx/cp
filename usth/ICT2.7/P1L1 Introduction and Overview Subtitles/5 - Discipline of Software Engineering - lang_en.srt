1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,469
And even if we don't go to these extreme examples, I'm

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,380
sure that you have all experienced

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,540
software problems, typically manifested in what

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,630
we call a crash. And that crash might happen while you're

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,230
finishing your homework or that three-page long email that you were preparing

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,900
for the last two hours. But why's it so difficult to

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,220
build software, or better, why's it so difficult to build good software?

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,200
And how can we do it? This is exactly the topic

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,190
of this class. And the reason why software engineering is a fundamental

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,330
discipline in computer science. To motivate that, in this class, we

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,259
will study a set of methodologies, techniques, and tools, that will help

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,150
us build high quality software that does what it's supposed to

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,540
do. And therefore, makes our customers happy. And that does it within

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,375
the given time and money constraints. So within the budget that

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,300
is allocated for the software. Before

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,222
jumping into today's software engineering techniques

17
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,010
though, let me take a step back and look at how

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,240
we got here, as I believe it is very important to have

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,690
some historical perspective on how this discipline was

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,840
born and how it was developed over the years.
