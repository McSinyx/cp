00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,580
One thing you need to know right away about software processes

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,750
is that there's not just one single process, but there are multiple,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,840
possible processes, depending on your context, depending on the kind of

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,535
applications that you are developing. In this course, we are going to try

5
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:14,760
to cover the spectrum of the possible processes, as much as

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,900
possible, by focusing on four main software processes. The first one is

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,480
what we call normally the waterfall process. And, we call it waterfall

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,490
because in the process we go from one phase to the other

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,300
in the same way in which water follows the flow

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,910
in a waterfall. The second process that we consider is what

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,580
we call evolutionary prototyping, and in this case, instead of

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,790
following this set of rigid steps, all we're trying to do

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,930
is to start with an initial prototype and evolve it

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,670
based on the feedback from the customer. We will then move

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,150
towards a slightly more formal process, which is the rational unified

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,590
process or the unified software process. And this is a kind

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,040
of project heavily based on the use of UML, so we

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,263
will also cover UML when discussing this kind of project. Finally,

19
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:58,680
the fourth kind of process we will consider is the family

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,670
of agile software processes. And these are processes in which we

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,280
sacrifice the discipline a little bi,t in order to be more

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,380
flexible and be more able to account for changes and in

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,760
particular for changes in requirements. We are going to cover each

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,620
one of these four processes extensively in the rest of the class.
