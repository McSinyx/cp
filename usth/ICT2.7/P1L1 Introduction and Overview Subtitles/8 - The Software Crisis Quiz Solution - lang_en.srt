1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,440
So, if you think about what we just discussed. Definitely one

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,210
of the causes was the increasing product complexity. Products were becoming more

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,510
and more complex and software was replacing more and more, what

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,860
was before, provided by hardware components.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,160
Slow productivity growth was another problem,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,350
because programmers could not keep up with the additional complexity of

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,720
the software that they had to develop. I would like to say

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,480
there was lack of funding for software engineering research because I'm

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,230
a software engineering researcher, but that was not one of the reasons

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,200
for the software crisis. Instead, it was

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,140
the rising demand for software. Again, more

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,060
and more software was being required and

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,850
more and more software was replacing hardware.
