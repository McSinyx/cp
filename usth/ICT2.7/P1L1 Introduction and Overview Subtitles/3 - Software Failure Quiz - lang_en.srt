00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,940
Now that you watched this small video, I like

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,660
to ask you, what is this? Do you think

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,330
it's fireworks for the 4th of July celebration, or

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,280
maybe it was a flare gun in action, or

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,240
maybe again it was the explosion of the Ariane

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,280
five rocket due to a software error. What do

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,190
you think? And in case it helps, I'm also

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,450
going to show you an actual picture of this event.
