00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,200
So now I want to ask you one additional question, which is how many lines

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,030
of code a day do you think professional

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,370
software engineers produce? Do you think they produce

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,160
25 lines of code? Between 25 and 50? Between 50 and 100? Between 100 and 1000?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,720
Or more than 1000 a day? And remember

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,379
that here we're talking about professional software engineers.
