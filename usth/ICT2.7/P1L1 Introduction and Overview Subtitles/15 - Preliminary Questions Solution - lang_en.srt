1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,450
Studies has shown that, on average, developers produce between

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,030
50 and 100 lines of code a day. And that

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,530
might not seem much. Why, why only 50 to

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,580
100 lines of code in a whole day? And the

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,350
answer is because coding is not everything. When you

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,020
develop a system writing code is not the only thing

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,890
you have to do. It's not the only activity that

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,800
you have to perform. And that's a very important point.
