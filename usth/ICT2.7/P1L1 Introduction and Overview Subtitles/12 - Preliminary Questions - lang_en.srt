00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,450
So, now before we actually jump to the

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,410
discussion of software processes I want to ask you

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,770
a couple of preliminary questions. The first one is,

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,140
what is the largest software system on which you

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,860
had worked? And you should enter here the size.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,850
And the second question I'm going to ask is how

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,070
many LOC or how many lines of code per

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,380
day you were producing when working on this system?
