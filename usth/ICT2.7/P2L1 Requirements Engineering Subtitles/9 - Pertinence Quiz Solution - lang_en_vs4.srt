1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,620
So the first requirement is definitely pertinent. Members of the gym shall

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,740
be able to access their training programs. It's pretty normal for members of

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,710
the gym to have a training program. And therefore, the system should allow

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,900
them to access them. Similarly for the second one. The system shall be

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,450
able to read member cards. Normally when you get into a gym

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,420
if you have a member card, you'll have to either show it to

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,010
somebody, or nowadays swipe it, and so the system should be able to

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,410
recognize the customer given the card.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,710
The third requirement is probably not pertinent,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,090
because I cannot think of any meaningful case in which the system

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,729
should know what is the members' commute time. The fourth requirement, personal

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,750
trainers shall be able to add clients, is also probably pertinent. Assuming

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,870
that we have personal trainers in the gym, and they should be

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,710
able to get clients, to work with the clients of the gym,

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,140
and therefore, they should be able to add them as their clients

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,620
to the system. And finally, the last requirement, the list of members

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,800
shall be stores as a linked list. This is really something about

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,130
the how, more than the what. And therefore, for what we say before

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,720
is probably not a pertinent requirement, so we're not going to mark this one.
