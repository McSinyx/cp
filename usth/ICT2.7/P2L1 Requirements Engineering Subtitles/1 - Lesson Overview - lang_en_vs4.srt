Hello and welcome to the second part of our software engineering course. In the

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,030
previous mini-course, we discussed some basic principles

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,430
behind software engineering. We provided an overview of

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,790
several software process models and we introduced

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,530
some important tools that can help developers

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,363
increase their productivity. In this mini-course, we

7
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:25,740
will focus on requirement and prototyping. More precisely,

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,840
we will discuss in depth requirements

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,400
engineering activities. We will also discuss

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,950
techniques to perform a system analysis

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,720
and design in an object-oriented fashion. So,

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,250
let's start the first lesson of this mini-course, which is about the use

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,230
of engineering techniques to understand and

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,450
specify the purpose of a software system.
