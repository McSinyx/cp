00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:02,360
Among the requirement that we can collect from the application

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,030
domain, we need to distinguish between two main types. And you've

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,540
probably heard about these ones.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,650
Functional requirments and non-functional requiremnts. Functional

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,020
requiremetns have to do with the functionality of the system, with

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,660
what the system does with the computation. For example the elevator

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,660
shall take people to the floor they select. That's a functional

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,650
requirement, that has to do with the functionality of the system.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,550
Or for a very simple one, the system has to output

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,620
the square root of the number past as

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,910
an input. So these kind of requirements have in

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,630
general well defined satisfaction criteria. So, for example, if

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,420
for the latter one that we mentioned it is

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,560
pretty clear how to check whether the output

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,784
is actually the square root of the number passed

16
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:43,535
in input. Non-functional requirements, conversely, refer to a system's

17
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:46,800
non-functional properties, systems qualities.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,120
Such as security, accuracy, performance,

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,220
cost. Or, you know, usability,

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,910
adaptability, interoperability, reusability and so

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,850
on. So, all these qualities the don't necessarily have to

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,520
do with the functionality. And, unlike functional requirements, non functional

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,060
requirements Do not always have clear satisfaction criteria. For example,

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,670
if we say that the elevator must be fast, that's

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,640
a non-functional requrement. Right? It has to do with the

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,030
speed of the elevator, which is a quality of the

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,535
elevator. But, it, it's not clear how such a requirement

28
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,980
could be satisfied. How could we tell whether the elevator

29
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,000
is fast or not. So, what we need to do

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,390
in these cases Is that we need to refine these

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,300
requirements so that they become verifiable. For the example that

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,360
I just mentioned, for instance, we might say that the

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,730
elevator must reach the requested floor in less than 30

34
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,190
seconds from the moment when the floor button is pushed.

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,030
This is still a non-functional requirment, but is a verifiable one.
