1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,610
These issues and difficulties can result in requirements

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,780
that show various problems. Two particularly relevant and

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,880
common problems are completeness and pertinence. Or better,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,750
the lack of completeness and pertinence. Completeness refers to

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,560
the fact that it is often extremely difficult

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,370
to identify all of the requirements. That is it

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,890
is very difficult to have a complete picture

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,780
of the purpose of the software. So what happens

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,540
is that incomplete requirements are collected and the software

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,500
is missing functionality that is important for the user. Pertinence

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,720
conversely has to do with the relevance of the

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,770
requirements. To avoid completeness problems developers often end up collecting

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,640
a lot of irrelevant when not conflicting requirements. In

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,060
these cases what can happen is that the software could

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,120
either end up being bloated that is it might

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,290
contain a needed functionality. The functionality represented by these extra

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,120
requirements or it might even be impossible to build the

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,480
software due to the conflicting additional requirements. And to make

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,920
things even worse collecting all of these requirements sometimes doesn't

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,390
even solve the completeness issue. So you might end up

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,800
with a set of requirements that is not only incomplete

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,740
but it also contains extra information that can be harmful

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,450
to the system. So again the bottom line is that

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,310
gathering an adequate, accurate, complete,

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,500
and pertinent set of requirements that

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,100
identify the purpose of a software system is an arduous task.
