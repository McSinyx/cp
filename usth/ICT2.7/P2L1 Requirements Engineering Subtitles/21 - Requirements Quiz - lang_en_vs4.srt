00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,940
After all these talking about requirements, let's have a small quiz, I

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,019
want to ask you which of the

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,840
following requirements are non-functional requirements? And here

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm listing the requirements, the first one says at the BowlingAlley program

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,420
keeps track of the score during a game, the second one is that

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,720
the WordCount program should be able to process large files. The third

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,580
one is that the Login program for a website. Should be secure, and

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,880
finally the last one says that the vending machine program should take coins

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,430
as an input from the user. So, I want you to mark all

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,590
the ones that are non-functional requirements, that

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,640
don't refer to the functionality of the system.
