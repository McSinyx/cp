1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,550
Once we collected the required knowledge on the requirements for

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,120
the system that we're developing, we need to model it in

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,430
a structured and clear way, so that it can be

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,100
analyzed and refined. And there are really tons of ways to

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,840
do that, depending on your focus and objectives. More specifically,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,940
when modeling requirements you need to decide what you want to

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,710
model and how you want to model it. So let's look

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,390
at these two aspects independently. What you decide to model depends

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,270
on where your emphasis is. That is on which

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,390
aspects of the requirements you want to focus. For

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,880
example if your emphasis is on the characteristics of

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,970
the enterprise of the company that you are analyzing you

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,240
may want to model goals and objectives of the

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,380
company, or its organizational structure, its task and dependencies

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,040
and so on. Conversely, if your focus is on

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,500
information and behaviors, you might want to concentrate on aspects

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,800
such as the structure of information, various behavioral views

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
some of which we will see in the next

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,650
lesson, or maybe time or sequencing requirements. Finally, if

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,750
you're mostly interested in the quality aspects of your

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,790
system, you will focus on the various non-functional properties

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,070
of the software that are relevant in the context

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,570
considered. For example reliability, robustness, security, and so on.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,550
You will just pick the ones that are relevant for

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,540
your context. And as we said, there's a second dimension.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,050
After you have decided what to model in your system,

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,480
you have to decide how you want to model it.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,860
So I want to show here some options for modeling

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,380
enterprises, information, and quality aspects. And as you can see

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,100
here for each type of information there are many possible

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,840
models that we can use to represent it. And all

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,750
these models have advantages and

33
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,400
disadvantages, different levels of formality and

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,000
different focus. Something else that I want to point out

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,145
about these models is the fact that these models are often

36
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,980
orthogonal to one another, especially if we consider models in different

37
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,620
categories. So what that means is that they're complimentary rather than

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,310
mutually exclusive. Different models can be used to provide views

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,290
of the requirements from different perspectives, and we will not see

40
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,700
most of these models in this course, but I wanted to

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,550
list them anyways to give you an idea of how many

42
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,490
there are and how vast is this area. As far

43
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,540
as we are concerned in the course and for the

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,660
projects we will express requirements using one of two main

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,010
ways. Using natural language, that is informal specifications and using

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,600
UML diagrams, which is graphical models. And we will introduce

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,840
UML and the most important diagrams in the next lesson.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,330
And the only other type of models that I want

49
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,610
to mentions explicitly are goal models because they're extremely popular.

50
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,930
So the main idea with goal models is it start with the main goal of

51
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,990
the system and then keep refining it

52
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,654
by decomposing it in sub-goals. So it's kind

53
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,610
of a very natural way of progressing.

54
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,210
And you continue this refinement until you get

55
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,150
to goals that can be operationalized, and represent

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,380
the basic units of functionality of the system.
