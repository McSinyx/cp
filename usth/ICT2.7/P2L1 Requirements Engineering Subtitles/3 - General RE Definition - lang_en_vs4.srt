1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,900
Basically, and roughly speaking, requirements engineering, which is

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,630
also called in short, RE, is the process

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,520
of establishing the services that the customer requires

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,530
from the software system. In addition to that, requirements

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,360
engineering also has to do with the constraints

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,900
under which the system operates and is developed. Requirements

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,770
engineering is a very important activity for several

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,450
reasons. In particular, as we also saw in earlier

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,860
lessons, many errors are made in requirement specifications. So many

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,100
errors are made because we don't do requirements engineering in

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,670
the right way. And many of these errors are not

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,340
being detected early. But they could be if we were

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,350
to do RE in the right way. And, unfortunately, not

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,510
detecting these errors can dramatically increase software costs. So that's

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,250
the reason why requirements engineering is important, and why it

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,730
is important to do it in the right way. The final

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,660
result of the requirements engineering process is a software

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,230
requirements specification that we also called SRS. We will discuss

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,060
SRS later in more details and also when we talk

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,740
about the projects for the course. For now, it is

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,040
enough to say that the software requirements specification and

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,280
the requirements engineering, in general, should focus on what the

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,290
proposed system is intended to do, and not on the

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,280
how it will do it. In fact, how the system

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,450
will do what it is required to do is something that we

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,170
will discuss when we talk about design of a system in later phases.
