00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,060
And the answer is clearly no.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Obviously, there are many missing requirements here.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,910
For example, requirements about registration for the

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,560
customers, requirements about fitness program creation, membership

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,481
types, and so on. Plus, we are also missing all of the nonfunctional

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,270
requirements, which we haven't seen yet, but that we will discuss in a bit.
