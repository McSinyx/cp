1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,920
So let's go through the list. Definitely irrelevant requirements

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,370
cannot lead to missing functionality in the final product, because

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,730
irrelevant requirements actually refer to unneeded functionality in the system.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,030
So functionality that is put in the requirements, but it

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,120
is not really needed. So we're not going to mark

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,400
this one. Indeed, irrelevant requirements can introduce inconsistencies. So they

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,490
could be irrelevant requirements that not only are not pertinent

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,620
but they are inconsistent with some of the pertinent requirements.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,220
They can also waste project resources, because if we spend time

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,920
designing and then implementing the parts of the system that we

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,410
refer to these irrelevant requirements, of course, we are wasting project

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,570
resources. And I will not mark the last one because there's really

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,220
no correlation between any irrelevant requirements and bugs in the software

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,350
system. Of course, by implementing the part of the system that refers

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,960
to an irrelevant requirement you might introduce a bug. But that's

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,020
not necessarily the case, and there really no correlation between the two.
