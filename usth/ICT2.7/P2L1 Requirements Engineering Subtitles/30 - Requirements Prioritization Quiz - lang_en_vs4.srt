00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,090
Now that we talked about requirements prioritization, let's try to see

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,110
how this might work in practice. Imagine that you have collected the

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,560
folowing set of five requirements for an ATM system, but only

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,680
have resources to satisfy two of them. Possibly three. I would like

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,550
for you to look at this list and suitablely prioritize the

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,220
requirements by marking them as mandatory, in this case you're going to put

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,840
an M in the space. Nice to have, in this case you're

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,350
going to put an N. Or superfluous, in this case you're going to put

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,005
an S. This is the set of requirements, the first one

10
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:30,342
says that the system shall check the PIN of the ATM

11
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,863
card before allowing the customer to perform an operation. The second

12
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:37,575
says that the system shall perform an additional biometric verification of

13
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:40,881
the customer identity for example a check of the customer's finger

14
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:44,294
prints before it allows the customer to perform an operation. Then

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,466
we have that the system shall allow customers to withdraw cash

16
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:50,580
using an ATM card. The system shall allow customer to deposit

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,350
money using an ATM card. And the system shall allow

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,330
customers to change the pin of their ATM card. So again,

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,600
mark those as mandatory, nice to have, or superfluous considering the

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,170
fact that you can satisfy only two, possibly three of them.
