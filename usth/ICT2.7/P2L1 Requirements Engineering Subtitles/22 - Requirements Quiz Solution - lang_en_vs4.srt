1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,710
So, the first requirement clearly refers to some specific functionality of

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,230
the Bowling Alley system, because it talks about what the system has

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,420
to do from a functional standpoint. So, it's definitely not a non-functional

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,400
requirement. On the other hand, the fact that the Word Count system

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,320
should be able to process large files, is telling us something not

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,580
about the functionality of the system, but rather about its qualities. The

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,600
fact that it has to be scalable, that it has to be

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,190
efficient and so we can consider this to be a non-functional requirement.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,010
Similarly, the fact that the Login program for a

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,390
website should be secure is definitely telling us something

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,800
about the quality of the system that has little

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,026
to do with its functionality. And so this is

13
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:36,680
also a non-functional requirement. Finally, the fact that the

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,980
Vending Machine program should take coins as an input

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,010
from the user is telling us something about the

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,100
functionality of the program and therefore, is a functional requirement.
