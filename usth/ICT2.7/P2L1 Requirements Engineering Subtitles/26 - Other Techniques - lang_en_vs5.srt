00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,370
So just for completeness, I want to mention some other

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,340
techniques besides the traditional ones that we just saw that

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,880
can be used for requirements solicitation. And these other

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,740
techniques can be divided in three main groups. There are

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,820
collaborative techniques that were created to support incremental development

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,850
of complex systems with large diverse user populations. An example

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,130
of such techniques which is widely used and you

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,120
might know is brainstorming. There are also social approaches and

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,140
these are approaches, techniques that exploit the social

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,520
sciences to better collect information from the stakeholders and

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,310
the environment. And among those I just want to mention

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,730
ethnographic techniques which are based on the idea of

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,100
collecting information on the participants by observing them

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,660
in their original environment. Finally cognitive techniques, leverage cognitive

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,490
science approaches to discover expert knowledge for example they

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,260
can be used to understand the problem solving methods.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,000
And in case you're interested in finding out more about this and

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,580
other techniques, I'm providing some references in the notes for the lesson.
