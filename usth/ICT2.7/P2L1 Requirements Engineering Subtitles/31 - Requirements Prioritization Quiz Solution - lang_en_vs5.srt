1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,640
Looking at the requirements, and knowing that we have only two

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,630
that we can satisfy for sure, it makes sense to first mark

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,080
as mandatory the ability to withdraw cash, which is the most typical

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,650
use of an ATM machine. We are therefore going to mark this requirement

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,260
with an M, for mandatory. It also makes sense to mark as

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,390
mandatory the fact that the ATM system checks the PIN of the

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,480
card being used by the customer, as that's the typical level of

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,680
security that the customer would expect,

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
therefore we're going to mark as mandatory

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
also the first requirement here. And of course we

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,930
could also perform biometric verification, but based on our knowledge

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,640
of the domain, it seems like that should be

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,410
an additional verification, rather than the main and only verification

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,170
for the system. We will therefore mark it superfluous.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,720
That is something that we can postpone until a later

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,100
release, the second requirement. Finally,

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,740
another typical operation that customers

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,070
perform at ATM machines is depositing. Whereas changing an ATM

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,850
card's PIN is not such a common operation. We'll therefore mark

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,710
it nice to have this fourth requirement and as superfluous, the

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,420
last one. So at the end, what we have is that

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,540
we have two mandatory requirements which are the two that we can

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,280
satisfy for sure. One, nice to have the requirement, which is

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,960
the possible third requirement which we might have time to satisfy. And

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,980
the other two that are marked as superfluous, as something that

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,100
we might do later, for example in a subsequent release. And of

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,060
course there is something subjective in these answers. But

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,020
again, based on our knowledge on our understanding of

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,910
the domain, these are the one that makes more

30
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,640
sense for an ATM system as we know it.
