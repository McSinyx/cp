00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,010
Why collecting, modeling, and analyzing requirements? We might realize

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,310
that the resources available for the project are not enough

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,000
to satisfy all of them. For example, there's not

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,450
enough time, not enough money, not enough manpower. And therefore,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,590
there are some requirements that we won't be able

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,760
to satisfy. In these cases, we must prioritize our requirements,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,310
by classifying them in one of three classes. The

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,270
first class is mandatory requirements, and these are the requirements

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,770
we must satisfy. Then there are the nice to have requirements that are the

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,170
ones that we will satisfy if resources

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,740
allow. And finally, there are the superfluous

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,440
requirements, and those are the requirements that

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,770
we're going to keep around, but that we're

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,010
going to postpone. For example, we might decide

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,770
to satisfy them in the next release.
