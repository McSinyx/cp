00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,880
Now that we know what the requirements are and

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,520
their main types, let's discuss where requirements come from and

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,610
there are many possible sources for requirements so I'm

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,610
going to list here the main ones. The first one are

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,440
clearly stakeholders, anybody who is effected by the system

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,830
and its functionality. Customers, users, and so on. The second

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,610
typical social requirement is the application domain. For example,

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,380
the fact that my software is running within a bank,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,930
or within a school. Why is the application domain a

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,410
social requirement? Well, because there are constraints that are characteristics

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,140
of the application domain that will affect the functionality of

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,130
the system. For a simple example, just think about regulations.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,400
So banking regulations and school regulations in these cases. Those

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,120
are things that might affect the functionality of my system

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,570
and, therefore, that may become part of my requirements. And,

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,120
finally, documentation can be an additional source of requirements. For example,

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,110
notes, papers, manuals, books. So everything that refers to

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,610
the functionality of the system that we're going to build.
