00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,530
Now that we talked about completeness and pertinence, let's consider an

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,200
information system for a gym. I'm going to give you a

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,580
list of possible requirements and I want you to mark in

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,530
that list all the requirements that you believe are pertinent. So let

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,030
me read the list. Members of the gym shall be able

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,770
to access their training programs. The system shall be able to

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,894
read member cards. The system shall be able to store members'

8
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:25,150
commute time. Personal trainers shall be able to add clients. And the

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,570
list of members shall be stored as a linked list.
