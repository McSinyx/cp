1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,780
Since we just discussed application

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,770
domain, machine domain, and the specificiation,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,760
let's make sure that these concepts are well understood. To do that,

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,740
I'm going to use a quiz, and I would like for you

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,590
to refer to the figure that we just discussed that I'm also

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,050
reproducing here on a small scale on the right. And then

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,080
referring to the figure, you should indicate for each of the items

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,140
that I'm going to show you here shortly. Whether they belong to

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,360
the machine domain. In this case, we're going to put a one next

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,150
to the icon. The application domain, in this case you should

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,410
put two. Or their intersection, and in this case you should

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,100
put three. So this is the lists of items. So let

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,750
me read it. An algorithm sorts a list of books in alphabetical

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,070
order by the first author's name. A notification of the arrival

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,380
of a message appears on a smart watch. An employee wants to

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,150
organize a meeting with a set of colleagues. And finally, a

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,690
user clicks a link on a web page. So again, put 1,

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,740
2, or 3 here in these lots, depending on whether you think that these items

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,840
belong to the machine domain, the application

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,910
domain, or their intersection. So, their specification, here.
