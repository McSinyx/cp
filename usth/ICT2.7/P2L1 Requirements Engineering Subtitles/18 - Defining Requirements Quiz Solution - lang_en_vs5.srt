1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,460
So let's look at each one of these items individually, starting from

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,260
the first one. And here this item has to do with how

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,250
the machine stores the information and

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,240
how the corresponding algorithm is written.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,920
But it has no bearing in the real world. That is, in

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,720
the application domain. Therefore this. Definitely

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,200
belongs to the machine domain, and

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,610
we're going to put a one here. What about a notification of

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,980
the arrival of a message on a smart watch? This is an

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,170
event that is generated within the machine, but it has an effect,

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,480
an observable effect, in this case, in the real world as well.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,780
Therefore, we're going to mark this as three. So this is an

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,460
event. This is something that belongs

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,160
to the intersection between the application

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,480
domain and the machine domain. So it's something that could be in

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,730
the specification. Now what about an employee that wants to organize a

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,850
meeting with a set of colleagues? This is an event that belongs

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,460
to the application domain because it is a fact that it's true

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,290
that exists. In the real world independently from the existence of a machine.

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,380
Therefore, we're going to mark this as two.

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,890
Finally, the event of a user clicking on a

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,950
link on a web page is an event that occurs in the real world but that has an

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,932
effect also within the machine and, therefore, we're

24
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:04,920
going to mark this as three, something that happens

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,730
at the intersection. between these two domains, and once

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,060
more, something that could be in a specification.
