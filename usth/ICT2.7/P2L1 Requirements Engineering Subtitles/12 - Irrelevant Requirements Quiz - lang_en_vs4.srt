00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,400
In the previous quiz, we saw that some of the requirements

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,920
that they put in the list were not pertinent. They were

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,590
irrelevant. So let me ask you. Why can irrelevant requirements be

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,170
harmful? Why is that a problem to have irrelevant requirements? So

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,060
here, I'm giving you four possible answers. And I'd like for

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,150
you to mark all that apply. Can irrelevant requirements be harmful

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,210
because they may lead to missing functionality in the final product.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,390
Because they can introduce inconsistency. Because

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,410
they can waste the project resources.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,170
Or because they may introduce bugs in the software system. And

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,680
as I said, more than one can be a valid reason.
