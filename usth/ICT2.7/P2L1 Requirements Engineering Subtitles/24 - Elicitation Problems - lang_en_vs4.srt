1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,440
Unfortunately, extracting requirements from these sources is not

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,220
a straightforward task, as there are many issues involved

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,470
with the requirements elicitation. One first problem is the

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,930
thin spread of domain knowledge. Knowledge is rarely available

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,970
in an explicit form, that is, it is

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,310
almost never written down. Moreover, knowledge is often distributed

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,410
across many sources. For example, in the graphical depiction

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,590
here, to find out that this is the purpose

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,240
of the project. The developer, the analyist, needs to talk

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,870
to a lot of different people. And, to make things even

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,400
worse. There are often conflicts between the knowledge gathered from

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,610
different sources. A second issue is the fact that the knowledge

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,090
is often tacit. What is also called the say, do

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,052
problem. In the example shown here. For instance. We have a

15
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:47,650
customer that is describing to the analyst. The way in which

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,060
he accomplishes a task. So it performs these three steps and

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,300
reaches the goal. Whereas in practice, the actual way in

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,530
which this task accomplished is by going through a larger number

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,880
of steps to get to the same goal. So the point

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,650
here is that, even if the knowledge were more concentrated, so

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,660
not as spread as in this example. People simply find

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,680
it hard to describe knowledge that they regularly use. So it

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,740
is hard to make this knowledge explicit, to pass this knowledge

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,130
to someone else. Yet another

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,690
problem is limited observability. Identifying requirements

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,570
through observation is often difficult as the problem owners might be

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,550
too busy to perform the task that we need to observe.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,750
Or they might be doing a lot of other things together

29
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,980
with the task that we need to observe, so that becomes

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,530
confusing. That introduces noise. Moreover, even when this is not the

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,460
case, the presence of an observer might change their problem. It

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,020
is very typical for human subjects to improve or modify an

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,760
aspect of their behavior, which is being experimentally measured in response

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,110
to the fact that they know that they're being studied. You know

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,110
that somebody's studying you and you change the way in which you behave.

36
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,910
A typical issue. Finally, the information that we collect might be biased.

37
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,270
For several reasons. People might not feel free to tell you what you

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,030
need to know. Or, people might not want to tell you what

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,240
you need to know. For example, in all the common cases in which

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,870
the outcome might effect them, people might provide you a different picture

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,770
from the real one. In order to influence you. So, they might have

42
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,820
a hidden agenda, and mislead you, either

43
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,860
consciously or unconsciously. So, all these issues

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,370
add to the complexity of collecting requirements,

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,522
of identifying the purpose of a system.
