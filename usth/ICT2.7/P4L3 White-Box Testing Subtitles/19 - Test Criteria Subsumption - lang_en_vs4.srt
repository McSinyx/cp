1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
So we can now update our test criteria subsumption. We start

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,700
from this situation in which there are no relationship between condition

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,650
coverage, branch coverage and statement coverage. And when we add branch

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,160
and condition coverage, we can mark the fact that branch and

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,470
condition coverage subsumes branch coverage

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,370
and also subsumes condition coverage, for

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,660
the same reason. Therefore, this is a stronger criterion than both

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,100
branch coverage and condition coverage, and of course indirectly also soft

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,330
statement coverage. So once more, to make sure we are all

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,255
on the same page, if I develop a test rate that satisfies branch and condition

11
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,380
coverage, the same test will satisfy also

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,210
branch coverage, statement coverage and condition coverage, necessarily.
