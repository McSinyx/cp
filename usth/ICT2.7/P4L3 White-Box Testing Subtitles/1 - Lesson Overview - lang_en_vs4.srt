00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,570
In the previous lesson we discussed black box

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,120
testing, which is the testing performed based on a

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,760
description of the software, but without considering any of

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,440
software's internal details. In this lesson, we will discuss

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,490
the counterpart of black box testing, which is called

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,590
unsurprisingly white box testing or structural testing. And just

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,780
like we did for black box testing, we will

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,740
cover the main characteristics of white box testing and

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,620
this casts the most commonly used white box testing techniques. We

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,650
will conclude the lesson with the discussion of the main strengths and

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,540
limitations of white box testing. So that you will know, when to

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,950
use it? How to use it? And what to expect from it?
