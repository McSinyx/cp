Let's have another quick quiz about Subsumption. If we

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,720
consider Branch and Condition Coverage, does it subsume Branch Coverage,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,512
and therefore Statement Coverage? Or in other words, does branch

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:12,750
and condition coverage imply branch coverage? Answer yes, or no.
