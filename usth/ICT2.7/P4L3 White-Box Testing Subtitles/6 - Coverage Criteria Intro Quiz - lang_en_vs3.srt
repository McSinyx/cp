00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,780
So, now that we have our test specifications. Test specification number one that

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,740
says that a plus b must be greater than zero. And test specification

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,990
number two, for which a plus b must be less than zero. I'd

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,580
like to do another small quiz and ask you to write some test

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,440
cases that will implement these specifications. And I want you to write the

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,780
test cases in this format. I want you to specify for each one

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,300
of the test cases, what is the value of a that you need

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,160
to use. What is the value of b that you need to use.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,200
And since a test case, I like to remind you, is

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,960
not just a set of inputs. But is the set of

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,050
inputs plus expected output? I also want you to specify, what

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,040
is the expected output for these test cases? And in particular,

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,540
since we have two characteristics of the output, one is the

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,630
color of the output and the other one is the actual

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,040
value. I want you to specify for each test case, what

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,790
is the expected output color and what is the expected value?
