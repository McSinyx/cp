00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,310
Now let's see if we are all on the same page

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,180
on the concept of testing specifications, and we're going to do that through

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,280
a quiz. What I would like for you to do is to

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,830
tell me, what are some possible test specifications that will satisfy the

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,380
requirements that we just saw? And I want you to express this

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,270
specification in terms of constraints on

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,166
the inputs. Which means, what constraints

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:23,130
should the input satisfy in order for this statement to be executed,

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,210
and this statement to be executed, and you can write your answer

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,510
here in these two slots.
