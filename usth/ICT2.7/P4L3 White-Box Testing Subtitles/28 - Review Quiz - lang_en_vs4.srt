00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,220
Now let's do another quiz considering a slightly different piece

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,050
of code. In this case we have five layers of

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,684
code. We have a variable i, a variable j. Variable

4
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:11,620
j is read from the input. And then based on

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,500
this predicate, we either print the value of i or

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,850
simply exit. And what I want to know from you is

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,990
whether you can create a test suite to achieve statement

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,660
coverage for this simple piece of code. Yes or no?
