1
00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:03,890
But now want to ask a different question which is, does this test reveal

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,760
the fault at line three? Clearly, here there is a possible problem, because

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,440
if we pass the right input, we can have a division by zero.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,760
Is that revealed if we run this test within the code? Yes or no?
