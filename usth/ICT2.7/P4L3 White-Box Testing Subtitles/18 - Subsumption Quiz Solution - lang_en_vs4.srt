1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,880
In this case it should be clear that the

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,640
answer is yes, because branch and condition coverage actually includes

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,580
branch coverage. Therefore, by definition, any test rate that

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,505
satisfies branch and condition coverage

5
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:12,664
will necessarily satisfy branch coverage.
