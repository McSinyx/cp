00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,969
So let's have another quiz using the example that we just

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,660
used. This one is about achieving 100% branch and condition coverage. So

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,850
let me bring back the two tests cases that we just saw,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,420
and as we saw a few minutes ago, these tests cases do

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,540
not achieve 100% branch and condition coverage despite the fact that they

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,430
achieve 100% condition coverage. So both conditions are both true and false,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,820
for these test cases. So what I want you to do is

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,630
to add a test case, to achieve 100% branch and condition coverages.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,740
So specify the test case by writing here the value for x, and the value for y.
