00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,860
In the last lesson, we talked about black-box testing or functional testing,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,110
which is the kind of testing that you perform when you just

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,860
look at the description of the software. Today we're going to cover white-box

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,490
testing, which is the kind of testing that we perform when we

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,800
open up the box. We look inside the program, and we actually

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,490
test it based on its code. And there is one basic assumption

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,320
behind the idea of white-box testing, which is a very intuitive one,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
and the assumption is that executing the faulty statement is a necessary

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,380
condition for revealing a fault. In other words, if there is

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,690
a bug in the program there is no way were going to be

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,490
able to find this bug or this fault, if we don't execute

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,110
the statement that contains it. Which makes a lot of sense. As

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,240
we did for black-box testing, we're going to start by summarizing what

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,650
are the main advantages of white-box testing. The main advantage is that

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,050
it's based on the code, and as such, the quality of white-box

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,760
testing can be measured objectively. And what I mean here by objectively

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,390
is that if you think about black-box testing In many

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,630
cases, there were subjective decisions, there were had to be made

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,830
in order to define tests in a black-box fashion. In the

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,990
case of white-box testing, because everything is based on the quota,

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,965
we don't have to make such subjective decisions. And similarly, because

22
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:10,680
white-box testing is based on the code, it can be measured

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,250
automatically. So we can build tools and actually there are tools,

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,860
and there's plenty of tools, that can be measured, the level

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,670
of white-box testing can be achieved in a fully automated way.

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,620
And we're going to see some of them in the course of the

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,600
class. Another advantage of white-box testing is that it can be

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,700
used to compare test suites. So if you have two alternative sets

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,270
of tests that you can use to assess the quality of

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,360
your software, white-box testing techniques can tell you which one of these

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,580
two test suites is likely to be more effective in testing

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,350
your code. And finally, white-box testing allows for covering the coded behavior

33
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,470
of the software. What that means is that if there is

34
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,680
some mistake in the code and is not obvious by looking at

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,300
the specification of the code, white box testing might be able

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,330
to catch it, because it tries to exercise the code. There's many

37
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,430
different kinds of white box testing, there are control flow based

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,550
techniques, data flow based techniques, and fault based techniques. And for each

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,030
one of these family of techniques there are many variations. So

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,450
this field is very, very broad. In this lesson we will talk

41
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,110
about white-box testing by focusing

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,910
mainly on control-flow based testing techniques.
