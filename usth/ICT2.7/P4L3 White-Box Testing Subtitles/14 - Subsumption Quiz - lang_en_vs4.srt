1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,220
So now that we introduced an additional criterion,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,290
let's have a quiz to see whether everybody

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,410
understood the concept of subsumption. We know that

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,490
branch coverage subsumes statement coverage, but what about condition

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,230
coverage? Does it subsume branch coverage? Is it

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,720
the case that all of the test which

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,980
satisfy condition coverage will also satisfy branch coverage?

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,160
Think about it, and answer either yes or no.
