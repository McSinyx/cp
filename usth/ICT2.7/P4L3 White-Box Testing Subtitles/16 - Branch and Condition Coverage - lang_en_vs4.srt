1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:03,407
Let's go back to our test criteria subsumption representation, where

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:06,770
we already had branch coverage and statement coverage. In this case,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,350
if we want to add condition coverage to this page, we

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,050
have to put it here on this side, with no relationship

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,830
of subsumption with either branch coverage or statement coverage, which

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,270
means that the criteria are not comparable. So now let's consider

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,108
again our last example, and let's use a different test

8
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:25,060
with this time. We still have two tests, but the first

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,575
one has x is equal to 0 and y is equal to minus

10
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,370
5. And the second one, x is equal to 5 and y is

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,350
equal to 5 as well. Let's see what happens in terms of condition

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,740
coverage, when we run these tests. If we look at the first condition, x

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,820
is equal to 0. It is both true, for the first test case,

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,240
and false for the second one. As for the second condition, y greater

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,800
than 0, it is false for the first test case and true for

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,770
the second one. Therefore we've achieved a

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,400
100% condition coverage with these two tests.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,020
But what about branch coverage? If we consider the whole predicate,

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,620
instead of just the individual conditions, let's see what happens for the

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,090
two test cases. If we look at the first one, because

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,200
x is equal to 0, the overall predicate is true. As for

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,750
the second one, because the second condition is true, the overall

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,110
predicate is true. In other words, despite the fact that we're exercising

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,520
all the possible values for the two conditions, the overall predicate is

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,540
always true. And therefore, we're covering only one of the two branches.

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,591
So our coverage will be 50%. This is the reason

27
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,231
why normally the two criteria that we just saw, decision

28
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,205
coverage, and condition coverage are considered together. And the resulting

29
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:30,320
criterion is called branch and condition coverage, or also decision

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,030
and condition coverage. At this point the test requirements and

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,590
the coverage measure should be pretty straight forward, because they're

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,120
just considering the two criteria together. As far as the

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,960
requirements are concerned, they include

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,880
all the branches and individual conditions

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,580
in the program. Where as the coverage measure is computed

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,180
considering both coverage measures, both branch coverage and condition coverage.
