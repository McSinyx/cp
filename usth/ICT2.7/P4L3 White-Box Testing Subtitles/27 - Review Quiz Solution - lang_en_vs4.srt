1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,581
And the answer is no. So even path coverage's stronger criteria

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:06,376
that we saw is not enough to reveal this problem. And why

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:08,526
is that? So let me go back to a concept that

4
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:12,491
I mentioned in a previous lesson, the cost of exhaustive testing. Exhaustive

5
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:15,236
testing is really the only way in which we can exercise

6
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:18,230
all of the possible behaviors of a program. So we can say

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,884
even though it might sound like topology, that only exhaustive testing is

8
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:25,710
exhausted. All the coverage criteria that we saw are just process and

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,900
just approximation of a complete test. So test is a best effort kind

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,180
of activity. Coverage criteria help you assess

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,430
how well you tested but once more,

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,060
test can only reveal issues, can only reveal problems. You can never show the

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,530
absence of problems. And that's something is

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,377
important to remember when we do testing.
