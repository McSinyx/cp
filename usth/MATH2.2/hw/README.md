# Numerical Methods: Homework 1

My name is Nguyá»…n Gia Phong, my student ID is BI9-184.

The homework were written in Octave and saved as

* `linear`: interactive script to solve linear equation
* `quadratic`: interactive script to solve quadratic equation
* `cubic`: interactive script to solve cubic equation
* `fibonacci.m`: function `fibonacci (n)` returning a vector containing
  Fibonacci numbers from F<sub>1</sub> to F<sub>n</sub>

The scripts are named without any file extension following the \*nix traditions.
