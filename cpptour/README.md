A Tour of C++
-------------

These are my draft while following Bjarne Stroustrup tour to learn some C++11.
Not that I eventually fell for the language, but I did realize that I simply
cannot evite it forever. In fact, this is the preparation for a Python
extension.

Since the book is non-free (in either sense), I may not upload it. However,
one could try to look for it in a *lib*rary. *Gen*erally it's available.
